Overall I'm pretty darned happy with this little kitchen gadget.",OR,0

We used it for a party.  After the party we put the sever in the refrigerator and used it a few days later for another party. I washed the unit by hand and washed the storage cups in the refrigerator. At first we kept the condiments cool with ice cubes and then used small ice packs.,OR,0

"These shelf liners are handy - sized and formed to fit the shelf perfectly!  The reason for four stars and not five is they're a bit thin; that makes them easy for the vendor to pack and send but does raise the question of how durable they'll be.  Other than that concern about durability, just right!!",OR,0
I have used a downer for the last 10 years and it works great. I have one in my bathroom and the other in the office. The light is not dimmable and it does not affect my bathroom. It is a perfect size for my bathroom and is perfect for showering.,CG,1
"I would give this zero stars if I could.  It opened THREE normal sized cans - very, very, very slowly.  Then it stopped working and just made clicking sounds.  Absolutely worthless piece of junk.  The concept is good, and I think others make better ones.  But this one was a total waste of $20.",OR,0
This was disappointing. I loved it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just can't get the suction to run smoothly. The suction is so great it's like it's a little smaller than a regular pillow. I wish it was a little thicker.,CG,1
"They are affordable and easy to use. The quality is excellent for the price! I've used this product for ~1 year now, and no bag has ever teared on me while decorating sweets.

I needed a gift for someone I see socially and yet keep it light and kind of funny.  Knowing she loves wine and has a great sense of humor...this was perfect.

These are great pans as all the Fat Daddy pans are. I had a bit of difficulty separating them when they arrived. Ended up setting them in boiling water for a couple of minutes till them were hot to the touch then dropping ice cubes in the tip pan till the bottom of the pan was full. With one hot and one cold they separate easily.,OR,0
"It looks very nice. I also got the matching headboard and night stand. Needed something inexpensive and this fills the bill. Hopefully they won't all fall apart when the time comes to have to move them. Assembly was only a couple of hours for me. You do have to be smarter than a box of rocks (the dumb rocks, not the regular ones) to put it together.",OR,0
"We LOVE these bowls!!!  We needed something that my husband could eat cereal out of, we could use for soup and even cooking in the microwave.  We might buy another set!  They are tall, which helps keep the soup warm in our drafty house!  (low, flat bowls cool down the soup faster).  These are pretty enough to serve from, in my opinion.",OR,0

"I purchased a set of these for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES them!  They stay cold for an amazing amount of time, and as advertised, don't dilute whatever you put them in.

"In 2015, they will be charging for each grocery bag used in my area. I had always tried to use reusable bags, but I also found that they'd all be in use for something else when I had to go the grocery store.

"I'm very happy with this vacuum.  It is very light weight but yet has great suction.  I like that it automatically adjusts to the floor height -- go from bare floors to carpet easily.  The only disadvantage over my last Dirt Devil is that the hose is not connected.  If you want to use the hose, you have to connect it.  Not a big deal but nicer if it was always connected.",OR,0
"I used the Stainless Steel Mixing Bowl when I was laid up in a small hut in Thailand, sick with malaria and scurvy. I mainly used it to vomit in. It never rusted or decomposed. I also used it to cook, boil stream water to drink, and as a hat against the sun. It comes in handy if you are traveling in a less than luxurious country where you need to use everything at your disposal for many uses.",OR,0
"Really happy with the Pantone. The quality is good and it fits my Kitchen Aid vacuum perfectly.I bought this for a friend, and she is a very tall woman. She is very happy with it.

"Hard anodized cookware makes cooking enjoyable again!  The dutch oven evenly heats on my electric range, while living up to its non-stick performance promise.  You can slow cook a pot of chili in it all day and know its not going to burn or stick.  The slender handles are nice.  I've always hated thick, bulky handles that don't resist heat well.  I haven't had any heat problems so far.  I'm well pleased with my purchase.",OR,0
Package arrived on time and the product came rolled up in a box. It has a strong lavender smell to it / chemical smell to it which I think will go away after 48 hours of waiting. I like the patterns that are engraved on the top of the foam it adds extras to it. The only reason why it's four stars is because it could have came with a foam protector. Guess I use the sheets to substitute for that.,OR,0
I love how you can cut them to fit whatever size wire you are bundling.  I have an external USB port on my desk and the bundles of wire are varying in size.  These worked great.  I also was able to cut a nice small length for my headphones that I carry in my purse.  Haven't tried them on larger cable yet but found the Velcro strength more than adequate.  Would definitely purchase again and highly recommend this product.,OR,0
"These are nice little Infusers. The holes are a little small but if you don't overfill the container, the tea is able to steep better. One thing that is confusing is why the photo shows 4 when there are only two per order. Still, the craftsmanship is nice and they are user friendly without making a big mess. I have one at home and one in the office and love the ability to have a cup of my favorite loose tea now without a hassle.",OR,0
"I actually really like the look of it and when closing it it appears to create a pretty airtight fit.
Two things come across as a bit misleading though;

a) There is in no way a vacuum created or maintained, and
b) I can not see how it will allow for gases to escape.

Apart from that it's a neat looking container that appears to create a airtight space for my coffee beans.
Will use it for some time now to see how it makes my beans smell and taste :)",OR,0

You don't realize how deep they are until you zip & start packing! They both easily fit under the bed! Very happy!",OR,0

They hold an entire bag of onions with room for shallots and garlic heads. They hold a 5 lb bag of potatoes

For my needs this is exactly what I was looking for.",OR,0
This is the best. We have had the best of them all. They are strong and sturdy. They are dishwasher safe. The dishwasher is a breeze. We just have to keep them in the dishwasher for a few days and see if they break. We have used them for a few weeks and they are still working great. We like the size and shape of the bowls and they are pretty strong.,CG,1
"I have kitchen towels with and without hanging tabs, so I needed a good clip to hang them on.  I looked at some previous reviews that said that the towels slipped through the gap with this item, but I haven't found that to be a problem at all.  Maybe my towels are more hefty than the other reviewers.

The adhesive is absoutely solid, no slipping even when I've had water spashover from the sink above.  They look great and they hold my kitchen towels perfectly.  I've had them now for several months.",OR,0
"This matcha green tea whisk comes with a beautiful ceramic holder to keep the whisk in perfect condition. I chose a teal blue, which was so pretty! The whisk is made of bamboo. Using the whisk helps powdered matcha tea get the perfect consistency with no lumps or thick areas.

"If you ever peel potatoes you have to have this. It is such a good peeler.
I bought so many expensive peelers- I have the peeler graveyard but all those expensive ones are no good because they gouge the flesh of fruits and vegetables. Use this!! it just skims the fruit or veg. so you only peel the skin and you have the fruit or veg. in tact.
Fresh thin carrots are the test- those other peelers gouged the carrot so you would see the middle. Use this because you can safely peel without ruining the carrot. You can sweep it back and forth rather fast also- it does a great job!!!!!!!",OR,0
"It is my second Primula Espresso Coffee Maker. I should say that the quality went down significantly. The previous one had rubber gasket between upper and lower parts, this one has cheap plastic stuff which leaks when you pour the hot coffee. It is very unpleasant experience. Top portion of the maker has also deteriorated from the previous model. Hadn't I trashed the original box, I would have returned the maker after the very first use.

Ordered a rubber gasket to replace the original plastic one.

Update: the maker was returned as the quality of the product was below expectations. Rate was changed from 2 stars to 1. Not recommended for purchase.",OR,0

It is large enough for me, so soft, and I love the front zipper pouch to protect valuables while you snooze...or in my case snacks.

I am using it right now on the couch while I type this...I have a feeling it is going to be used a lot more than on the plane!  Got this discounted to try it out, so glad I did, it is my new best friend.",OR,0
"I purchased this for my new loveseat. Its add says ""fits most loveseats"" . I would argue that. The cover is quite small and barely covers 3/4 of the seating area. It would fit a mini couch, or a overstuffed chair but not a standard loveseat. The microfiber cloth is very thin too. One of the selling points which attracted me to the cover was its elastic back supportive strap, well the strap was so short I couldn't stretch the strap over the couch's back so I just cut if off.  I probably would have returned it but it was worth my time and the price of the product. I would not recommend.",OR,0

It's a sturdy piece. It works really well for me as a printer stand and the shelves are perfect for printer paper and other supplies. It is significantly cheaper than other printer stands and would also be great for its intended use as a nightstand.

This flask is awesome. It took me a little bit to figure out where the shot glass was but after looking at the pictures on amazon i figured it out and quickly got the shot glass free from the flask. I love that the shot glass is collapsible you can this flask anywhere and have a shot. The flask is sturdy no leakage when tipped upside down which is a big plus. The shot glass fits perfectly on the side of the flask and comes off with ease. This is great for taking in the club with you instead of paying for outrageous drink prices slip this in your jacket pocket or purse and you have free drinks all night.

"An oven mitt isn't really the kind of thing I put a lot of thought into, but in using this one, I've quickly come to appreciate the difference between an afterthought and an item borne of deliberate design.

I got this to replace a potholder I'd used for years, and I immediately appreciated the advantage of not having to worry about dropping it or slipping my grip. The design allots plenty of hand flexibility, and this is especially noticeable in the thumb area- All-clad promotes the thumb design on this product, and with good reason, as it allows total flexibility, which is crucial when handling hot pans and pots.

The craftsmanship is first-rate, and the grip and insulation are good- I never felt like I had a weak or unsteady hold on anything, and my hand never got warm, much less hot.

An oven mitt is a utility item that gets used daily; to my way of thinking, paying a bit more for an exponentially higher-quality mitt is an obviously good investment.",OR,0

I put Olive Oil in it (not the person) and it won't great. It was easy to spray after one or two priming pumps. The oil comes out in a line, I wish there was a way to make it have more of a spray but the oil does come out very easily. So I used the olive oil as a pot coating like a cooking spray. I could also see this being nice for salad dressing oils because it will limit the amount of dressing put on the salad.

"Ok so the trickiest step was step one.
the hardest step was step four
the most annoying step was assembling the drawers.

They said you would need two people to assemble it but i did it by myself. Let me tell you something, if you are stubborn enough or skilled enough or have the right tools you can do just about anything. I didn't have the right tools so i will let you guys decide on whether i am stuborn or skilled.

Assembly took about 2 hours. The piece, once assembled, is very solid. I expect many many years of use from this. The casters are also very nice too and the whole thing rolls with ease even when you add weight.

Why four stars. Well it is a series of small details. Some of the shelf pin holes are too big and the shelf pins just fall out. One of the door panels was build with the dark color facing out and the other with the dark color facing in. but probably the work part is that some of the pieces are warped. Nothing major but its enough that i can see it and it annoys me.",OR,0
"I almost gave it only 3 stars.
But, I decided that because it did the job I had hoped it would, I would give it 4 stars.
I would have given it 5 stars, except that after a couple of weeks, the foam padding on the kneeling board is showing signs of breaking down.
It will not last much longer.
I'll have to figure out a way to replace the padding with a good memory foam.
Then, it'll be a good kneeling chair.

With that said, I love the chair, or what ever you want to call it.
I've had it for about 3 weeks now.
My lower back, leg and foot problems are dissipating nicely.
I was worried that I might be turning diabetic.
A checkup confirmed that I wasn't.
The problems were most likely being caused by LONG HOURS sitting in front of a monitor.

It took a couple of weeks for my knees to begin getting used to it.
But, they're adapting nicely. Which is a good sign for anyone else because I'm in my 70's.
Anyone younger should should have an easier time getting used to it.

Using a piece of good firm memory foam on the knee board should make this an excellent kneeling chair.",OR,0
"This is the best pan I've ever used.  I also own a Wolf Gourmet pan, which is good, but this Viking pan is even better!  It conducts heat so well that I cooked chicken breasts last night on my gas burner stove on the low to low-medium heat setting.  A 1.5 tablespoon pad of butter melted so quickly yet didn't burn, which made cooking so unbelievably easy.  I also love how deep the pan is, reducing (eliminating) grease splatter.  The three chicken breasts were very large but had plenty of room in this pan to cook completely evenly despite the fact that the flames underneath did not extend more than a couple inches out from the center of the pan.  Even my children noticed a difference in the quality of the meat saying how juicy and tasty the chicken was compared to how it's usually cooked, especially when the breasts are so thick.

Note, the instructions that come with the pan tell you to condition the pan with oil before first use and then every few months after.  I did condition the pan per the instructions and I'm glad I followed that tip ahead of time.",OR,0

The color is great and the very soft feel makes it very comfortable to sleep on.  The only issue I have is that the coffee is still a little too hot and the cup is still cold when it's done.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to take a chance on a coffee mug.  I also like that the top is a little smaller than the bottom, but that's the best feature of this mug.

"This adorable tea ball is both whimsical and well made. The ball is made of durable stainless steel. The handle is in the form of a green tea leaf and is made of food safe silicone. Because the handle is made of silicone, it will not get hot, not matter how hot the water for your brew is. The coordinating silicone drip tray is a very nice piece to set your tea ball on when you remove it from your cup.

This tea ball easily holds a full tablespoonful, which is the amount the major majority of my herbal teas suggest to use for a 1 cup portion. The silicone portion fits snuggly inside the stainless steel ball part, yet is very easy to pull apart. Everything cleans up very easily with soap and water, when washed by hand. I do not have an automatic dishwasher, so I have not washed it in that manner.

"I love bamboo.  I am picky about what goes into my kitchen or, as in this case, what I give to someone else for their kitchen.  I read all the reviews (on Amazon and on other sites) about Joyce Chen and took a chance.  Big mistake.  Compared to my other bamboo utensils, these are cheap and what I would consider to be disposable.  They are not what I would call ""burnished"" by any means.  The product description uses words like ""beautiful and practical"" and ""impressive"" to describe Joyce Chen tools.  I wouldn't even think those words in connection with the utensils I received.  The surface was rough and uneven, and one item even had visible ""splinters"" on it.  It will only take a few minutes to sand them down and oil them to make decent (not wonderful) utensils, but I am disappointed that I will have to do so.  I would not want to wash these until I sand and oil them.  I think the water would get in and cause them to spit.  Of course, I ignored my own rule... you get what you pay for... and that's what I get.  Next time, I will pay more and get Totally Bamboo products.",OR,0
"These shouldn't even be a question whether to buy or not. If you get the Harman Kardon HKTS 14 or 8 speakers, get these stands. You won't regret it!!! Unless, of course you are hanging your speakers on the wall. I liked these because they not only lift to perfect height but look so impressive too. I bought two Harman Kardon stereo setups for my house, a AVR 240 and the CP 15 with the AVR 135. I bought four sets of stands because I don't want to mount speakers to wall and these do the trick perfectly. They are very well constructed and the base at floor is heavy enough that you won't worry about them getting knocked over too easily. The wires run up through the middle which is great and bases are slightly grooved up on rear to allow wires to pass through without making the stands sit uneven. They come with rubber feet so they won't scratch my wood floors and if you have carpet, they also come with little spikey type of nails to help them stay put. They are easy to put together that each pair only took 5 minutes to complete. Harman Kardon really does make a quality product both in the receivers and speakers and these speaker stands are no exception.",OR,0
"Finally, after buying many coffee makers, I thought it would be a nice addition to the kitchen.  It's not.  I am a firm believer that if you don't get it right, it won't work.

"An all in one idea sounds perfect but fails horribly.
Here's all the things that aren't good first:
1. Many parts to clean every time one brews
2. Condensation in the grinder causes coffee grind caking
3. 'Finished brewing' five beeps goes off and there's still 1/4 of the water left in the\ machine

If any of these things go wrong, it leads to big messes and weak coffee.
Way too many things have lead to mornings ruined.  After one spends 5 minutes and 10 gallons of water rinsing all the parts, you have to take this top mechanism piece of cheap plastic off the basket, rinse that, dump the basket, rinse that, check that no grounds are at the bottom of the basket holder, take off the carrafe's lid, check that no rogue grounds are stopping the shut off valve from letting the coffee run.  If you're tired and forget to empty the basket after being distracted from all the other steps, it over flows.  WHen the water collects in the system from not completing brews, you make a pot of coffee and it overflow. Grounds stop the basket hole, it overflows, the shut off valve's stuck with grounds, it over flows.  Think it's working well?  Check behind your counter, there's probably gallons of brewed coffee that has escaped and you don't know it!

"This came just in time to try! My daughter and I just baked a cake for my husband's birthday and the door bell rang with this delivery! I opened the box to find a well crafted cooling rack.  I had an older model drying rack that rusted and frankly was junk. I am pleased that this is made of stainless steel.  It is plenty wide enough to hold two round cake tiers without issue.  It has ample spacing to allow air to the cake, but are close enough to not damage our cake.  Best of all, the cakes removed easily and did not stick at all to the drying rack.  The raised legs allowed the air to circulate around the cakes.  Clean up was equal awesome! I rinsed in the sink, since there was really no cake on it and left in the drying rack. It dried sparkling clean. The cooling rack is also smooth. I ran my hands over it to ensure there was not any defects and to my pleasure, it was completely smooth.  I am so happy this came today and would definitely recommend the purchase to anyone who enjoys baking.

"I had never made lollipops but always wanted to. I have gotten into trying to make many new recipes and foods in the last few years and thought this would be fun so I placed my order for the mold.

The set comes with one mold and one set of sticks. If you want to make them again you would have to purchase more sticks. Our local hobby store sells them and you can order them online. The mold itself can be used in the freezer, microwave, and oven. It is also dishwasher safe;; however I could not test that as I do not own a dishwasher.

The mold does not come with any type of recipe for creating lollipops. If you look online however you can find many recipes for free. The mold only has a spot for a dozen to be made at once. For a family the size of mine, I would need to make several batches. It would be easier to have a larger set of molds or to purchase multiple sets.

The molds do not require spray as the pan is silicone and nonstick. They are easy to clean and since they are silicone and small and easy to store. I am looking forward to trying many new recipes with this mold.

"So I like big desks with lots of spots to organize your things on. My wife hated my previous desk, which was big with lots of organizing space. She thought it was ugly, but it was the only desk I could find that suited my needs in that exact way. Then I found a desk set that wowed both me and my wife. This credenza made a great extension of that desk set.

It's a simple design, but that belies the great functional details and style this desk offers you. The desk top is a good size with a nice slick finish that will make the room you have it in look better just by being there. The desk has some heft to it, but not so much where you cannot move it around. On top of the desk is a central opening with a cover for cables to come through. Under the desk is a nice cable management system going all across the center of the back board that ends next to holes in the side boards for you to run cable without hitting the ground. All in all a nice way to organize your cords.

The desk is not made of solid wood. If it were I would be worried as good solid wood furniture doesn't come cheap. What you do have is a nice, thick, layered particle board desk that is a good deal sturdier than what you normally find. Installation is pretty easy, but it is tedious if you don't have power tools. A Philips head screwdriver and maybe a hammer is all you need.

This credenza was used as an extension for a larger desk set I put together. You can do the same as this particular collection is very customizable. As a basic desk all on its own it makes for a good, solid worktable. I would recommend a hutch from the same collection to get the most out of it.",OR,0
"My wife is very particular about ""her things"", and when her tea kettle was starting to rust out, she hinted that she would like a new one for her birthday.  So I found this highly reviewed kettle on Amazon and thought it a good deal for many years of service.  When my wife received it for her birthday, she was not completely satisfied, but over the past two months she has ""gotten used to it"".  Here are her complaints:

1. Difficulty getting water into it.
  - with my wife's old kettle, she filled it through the spout.  The spout on this kettle is a bit narrower than her old one, so at first water would spill down the side and get the outside wet.  She also tried to use the filling lid on top, but the lid has tight tolerances (so steam doesn't escape or rattle around), and the handle doesn't move, so there is no clear path to the pot without getting the outside wet.

2. Difficulty eating water out of it.
  - as you can see from the picture, the spout protrudes from the upper quarter of the pot.  This means she has to hold the kettle at an almost 90 degree angle to pour her hot water, and dousing her hand with a good bit of hot steam.  With filling the kettle a bit fuller than she is used to, we are able to get around that problem.

Now that she's had two months of kettle ownership, she is much better at aiming water into the kettle, and doesn't have so many problems.  She has also noticed that with the flatter and wider bottom of the new kettle, it does heat faster, and it is easier to clean with the nice enameled finish.  However, I think next time that we need a new kettle, I'm just going to install a hot water dispenser at the sink.",OR,0

"The Spyderco Dragonfly is my go to, and it is a great deal for the price.  The other two have the same design, but they have different materials, so you should get the Spyderco Dragonfly in the same color as the other two.  I ordered the Spyderco Dragonfly as a gift to my wife, and she loved it.  She has also been using the Spyderco Dragonfly as a camping experience, and it has held up so far.  She is now very happy with the Spyderco Dragonfly.  She does enjoy the color and the design of the Spyderco Dragonfly, but the Spyderco Dragonfly is a little too large for her to carry with her.  She would probably prefer a different color for the Spyderco Dragonfly, but she does not have any complaints about the Spyderco Dragonfly.",CG,1
"I just don't like that it has the wide mouth part of it.

The only downside is that it's very hard to get out and then open the lid when you close it.

I think the orange color is a good thing for the outdoors.

"I have 3 sets of these gloves... two of the prevouos model with the criss cross velcro strips and one of the newer rubber strips.
I find the older model gave better support and position of the knuckes was aided from the tightening of the strips.
Are they better than handwraps? if you use cheap practice gloves, yes. Specially if your hands get sore easily.
but beware that they don't offer very strong wrist support, unless you really tighten them.
the stiching on one of them has come undone, but note that is probably from choosing a wrong size... if they are not snug enough and move around inside the gloves that maight be the case... I have two L mand an Xl the Xl has had the stichting come undone.
Not that it matters much... these suckers are for punching.  I have recently traded my cheap Everlast practice gloves for Title's Fighting brand sparring gloves. Perhaps I will go with wraps again.
but yes, they are good.
but beware after a couple of heated practices the stink on these gloves is seriously offensive... SERIOUSLY. I wash mine every two practices... although the new ones, seem to have worked on that, the material lasts 3 sessions between washing.",OR,0
"I bought two of these rash guards to take on a trip to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. I bought one in XL and the other in XXL. The XL fit perfectly, but not like a baggy XL t-shirt would. It fits me more like a Large t-shirt would. But that's they way it's supposed to be. I'm a little out of shape these days so I wanted to get the next size up so I'd have two for two different activities. The XL I used for snorkeling and scuba diving because I didn't want the shirt to be to loose while doing those activities. The XXL, which fit more like an XL t-shirt, I used for hanging around the pool and going to the beach in.

I used both shirts every day that I was in Mexico and they were awesome. They fit well, dried fast, and kept me from getting burned. My skin was just as white returning home as when I left for Mexico, so they did their job. =) Of course, that wasn't the only reason I bought them. I'm not in the shape I used to be, so I spared the people at the resort from seeing my big white belly. =P

These shirts are fantastic...I highly recommend.

"After much research (and waffling) I held my breath and ordered these bars along with the Sunlite Steel stem and was able to convert my craigslist 1986 Schwinn LeTour mixte to a fully upright riding position.  As I said in my review of the stem, I was so happy when I sat on the bike after the conversion that I cried.

Thank you other reviewers and bloggers...you gave me the courage to order the parts and the ability to finally sit completely upright.  My full review of the products together and process is on the Sunlite stem page...I don't want to bore with repetition.  I will say, the handlebars seem like very good quality to me.  I like the straight front which will accept a basket, and the grip part was long enough for my vintage Schwinn grips plus brake levers.  I have downtube shifters and, as others have noted, there is not enough room on the straight back portion to have grips, shifters, and brakes.  But it worked for me.  I did as another reviewer reported and angled the bars down a little, so my wrists are in their natural, straight alignment when on the grips.  Am loving the whole set up!

"This is my second set of these glasses.  The first lasted over a year before I decided to replace them.  Of the several different types of glasses I have tried these were by far the best, they fit well, fogging was minimal, and the molding did not obscure my vision.  This pair however only lasted a couple months (used about half a dozen times) before a plastic film on the lens began to flake off making them unusable.  I spoke with Amazon, they would not refund or replace due to it being over 60 days.  They suggested I contact the seller.  The seller it turns out is only a distributor and I was referred to ESS to complete a warranty claim.  I called them and was told I could get a replacement lens for about $20.  I told them that was unacceptable for something that should have and has in my experience lasted much longer than a couple months.  So after a few emails and about a month of waiting I did receive a replacement lens at no cost.

I understand that periodically manufacturing errors will occur even on the best products but it's frustrating when nobody wants to rectify the problem. Overall I'm happy with the product but very disappointed that Amazon, Sportsman Supply, and ESS were so reluctant to stand behind this product.",OR,0
"These are neither a good nor a bad glove; you just need to understand what you're ordering.  This is not a warm glove; it is a LINER, and a very thin, open weave liner at that.  You can see your hand through the loose weave, so you wouldn't wear these for principal cold weather protection for your hands.  They fit nicely and are comfortable with good finger length, and the biosensors work well on touch screens, although I don't understand why OR put biosensors only on the thumb and index fingers instead of on all the finger tips.  The glove is very flimsy and subject to pulls, runs, and catching on things, so I would not think them durable at all.  They also have scratchy tags sewn into the insides at the wrists, which tags are annoying and look difficult to remove.  Mine did not come with the clips shown in the photo (on Amazon) that hold the gloves together when not in use.  These gloves made me think about which fingers I use on my touchscreen, and I realized that I use more than just my thumbs and forefingers (I regularly use my middle finger) so for me this glove does not have enough biosensor tips.  I'm not wholly down on the gloves, but they are obviously really flimsy and apparently not intended to be warm.",OR,0
"I purchased a fixed blade Boker, and the seller sent me this by mistake. So consider this a review by a disinterested 3rd party who saw and handled it before returning it for a refund.
Unless a menacing look to a knife is all you are after, I find little else that this knife would offer. The knife is very tight and hard to deploy one- handed. The blade itself seems very cheap. Part of that is due to the fact that this knife has a chisel grind, (ground only on one side. The back side of the knife in the photo is just flat steel. No grind at all to produce an edge). One sided grind lowers production costs. Throw in the fact that 2/3 of the blade edge is curved, so you will need a curved whetstone to sharpen the blade, and you end up with get a knife that is unlikely to hold an edge long and that is difficult to maintain. I have 1 Boker knife (Arbolito) and am purchasing another, so I like their quality. Boker Plus is a low end brand for Boker with this Boker Plus knife is being made Taiwan. Speaking for this particular knife, I am very unimpressed. My 21 yo son had a similar opinion when I showed it to him. Personally, I have other folding knives that are 1/2 the cost and 10 times better IMO.",OR,0
"For a backpacking treat these are pretty good. I'm not positive what happened with other reviewers' packages, but mine tasted exactly like cheesecake. Maybe my wife has a subpar recipe and I've never been the wiser...

In any case, took these on a 14 mile hike and ate them halfway through. All 3 guys that had them liked them. Even my lactose intolerant buddy wanted more!

They are a little more dry and crunchy than anticipated, but once you chew on it for a while it gets better. My buddy suggested eating them with coffee, luckily I had brought some in my Tribe bottle. They were not as good with coffee and made it even more weird because they just floated and never took in any of the liquid! They tasted like strawberry more than lemon & lime until we read the ingredients.

I had them folded up and stuffed into my backpack and some of the cubes lost their graham cracker crust, but most was retained. To be honest the graham cracker dust was awesome with the last few cubes of cheesecake.

So to that end, are these great for prepping? Likely not - i'd rate them a 3 or 4 out of 10 for emergency rations. However, for backpacking i'd give them a hard 8 of 10 - especially when you've got a hard/long hike.  They are small (take up little space), light (weigh next to nothing), and taste good.",OR,0
"Interesting concept. I've seen a couple of mentions of the bumps and their purpose. I'm told they're to stimulate circulation. I don't know. They're not terribly comfortable and I would not want to sit on this thing with thin pants, or in pajamas or boxers, I do know that. If it were summer I would try throwing a towel across it to cushion the bumps and to keep my bare skin off the plastic.

It does work to keep your posture correct. I use it at my desk and I find it much more difficult to slouch. My biggest problem is that it is so narrow. I am about 6'4"" and 225 pounds. I'm not fat by any means. But my backside is too wide for this thing. My 11-year-old son could perhaps fit on it comfortably, but if you're an adult you might be in trouble.

I think it's a good idea, but just too small to be really effective (or comfortable). It's good that it comes with an inflating needle because I no longer have those around the house, my days of football and basketball being well behind me. It would be nice if it came with a pump but those are easy to obtain so I won't quibble over that.

I'd recommend it, despite the comfort issues, simply because it is better than the alternative. There are a lot of things we could and should do as we sit all day at our computers and ergonomics are critical. Get your monitor at eye level, your keyboard to where your arms and hands don't strain, and sit up straight! This, at least, will help with the latter until something better comes along.",OR,0
"Good Quality bag, should hold up well. Like the looks of it. Tapered front fits under seat well. Strap on rear for tail light is nice.
I don't care for some bags out there that have all kinds of outside straps, bottle holders, pockets, etc. This one is more streamlined with your stuff stored inside the bag, not held somehow on the outside. And the inside is roomy!

Held back on a 5 star rating for several reasons.

One, it's a little pricey. Forty bucks is a lot for a bag to store stuff on the back of your bike.

And secondly the design of how the top opens up could be better.
The top is held closed by two zippers down each side, plus a velcro closure across the front.
The velcro flap is located under your seat, where it is hard to get to. And it's strong velcro, so you really need to get a firm grip on it.
And then the zippers are held together with a strap, the idea being that you can pull on the strap and open both zippers at the same time.
In theory this sounds good but reaching the strap, which is also under the seat, is not the easiest thing to do either.

I ended up cutting off the strap holding the 2 zippers together. This helps quite a bit. Now I can quickly open the bag just on one side without having to undo the velcro. And you can pretty much grab what you want with just one zipper open.

IF the zippers opened from the rear, and the velcro closure was across the rear, then it would be an ideal bag and maybe I wouldn't feel like forty bucks was too much for it.",OR,0
"Synopsis
-------
I bought this board in June 09. I was so busy in Summer that I didn't touch it until January '10. I hit the wall with my run and Nordic Track Ski Machine no longer 'shock' my body. Having stuck in the house during winter months doesn't do good to the body either. Hence, I was gaining a bit of weight. I put this board behind my couch facing the TV and ever since then - I was hooked. It took me about 4-5 days to start getting a hang of it(I never skate board or roller blade before). I held on to the back of the couch during those 4-5 days to prevent any falls from happening. Effect
----
After 2 weeks, I am close to going back to my weight in Summer. My waist is trimmed again; I wake up to sore gluts and core muscles - the best feeling ever! I am now a believer in this equipment and will use it a lot more throughout the year. Activities
-------
I golf and hike in the Sierras a lot; both activities require a lot of core strength(especially when you start getting tired during the round or long hike). I started doing some core exercises about a year ago and noticed some improvements in both activities; more controlled golf swing and better posture during long hikes. I believe that this machine will strengthen my core more as I keep using it. Customer Service

"Tons of real estate...molle tabs, containers, cell phones, keys, keys, etc.

Great product...I had to replace a couple of these around the house. They were pretty expensive, and had to be replaced every few years. I ended up with this one.

I love it. I have a portable phone, a tablet, and a book bag. I also use it when I run errands or do stuff for my family. I have a very small purse, and this is perfect for that. It has a small pocket on the back, which is nice. It has a nice strap, which is nice. The pockets on the back are very small, which is nice for keeping stuff in a small bag. It also has a nice pocket on the top, which is nice.

It is very small, which is nice. It does not look like it will last very long, but it does look like it will last a long time. It is very light and very well made.

It is very easy to install, so you can take it on a long bike ride. It is a little heavy for my liking, but it is a nice small tool to have in your pocket.

I like the way it is made and the fact that it is made in the USA. It is well made and it is very comfortable. The only downside is that it is hard to put",CG,1
"Its easy to put together. No more hard water, flouride, etc. Im using one filter at the moment. I do not plan on using it in river waters, lakes, etc. since the filters are $89-$99 a pop, unless I have to.  The filters are ten dollars cheaper at Infowars. I will use it in a camping situation. If I should have to use it in a emergency situation and filter outside waters in it, Ill update.

The instructions say to flush the system out twice before using, in which I did. It takes awhile for the water to pass through the filter.

The water is silky almost like drinking distilled water.  There no smells or odd tastes. I drink a lot of water & its nice to drink from a stainless steel tank rather than a plastic Brita or plastic jug, even if it claims to be BPH free.

Instead of using my refrigerators ice cubes, I make my own from the AlexaPure Pro. The ice cubes are clearer and theres no more particles floating in my drinks after the ice melts.

I shouldve bought this a few years ago.

After a few months I took it apart & rinsed it out. A few weeks ago I looked at it & red rust looking marks occurred at the bottom of the top tank which sits in the bottom tank. They were set into 4-5 scratch lines and I though it was rust & I didn't want to use any abrasive on it to make sure. At 1st I thought this thing isn't made of stainless. I called My Patriot Supply & it turned out to be bacteria. Now I will use soap & water with a light scrub pad once a month to clean the inside surfaces as instructed by the person at MPS as it did take away the red bacteria.",OR,0
"Stop your search for a bike light and just buy this one. It's perfect. Previously, I had been using two headlights at once (a Planet Bike 2 Watt Blaze and a Bell Lumina) which works good but with the Cygolite you only need one light and it's totally worth the $80.. The brightest setting is actually too bright. I can't imagine a situation where you would need a light that bright. When you turn on the light it defaults to the second brightest setting which makes sense because this is the one you'll use when it's totally dark. As the sun comes up I switch to the next lowest setting. The flashing mode is great for dawn and dusk but be warned it's quite bright and you may severely annoy approaching motorists (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). To change levels you just click the big (and only) button conveniently located on the top of the light. To turn the light on or off you just hold this button down. The mount on this light is fantastic. I much prefer the thumb screw that this uses as opposed to the mount other lights use. In fact that was a selling point for me on this light and it's why I chose it over the NiteRider MiNewt 350. You can get the light on the bike nice and tight. Another nice feature is that the light can tilt up or down. This light is rechargeable which is the way to go. As long as you always have have a full charge you know you'll have a bright light. But make sure you charge it regularly because when it runs out of juice it shuts off. The battery is also simple to remove.  The light feels solid and it's withstood a light rain. I'm going to buy another mount so that I can use this light on more than one bike.",OR,0
"REALLY good for keeping my fitbit in its case! I can see where the FITBIT ONE'S case can eventually become loose!  So got these.  Why am I knocking off ONE star? FIRST BIG CON!!!! The price!  These are 7 SIMPLE silicone bands, yes.. you get a few, but really? $13.99???!!!!!  They must be making at least 95% or more profit on these. If I would have found anything comparable, I would have purchased them.  I can get whole cell phone silicone cases for my Samsung Note for $5 or $7 bucks on Amazon or eBay, these have much less silicone, and I could see $2.99 or even $7 (a dollar per band).

Only ONE is needed, not 2 as in the photo.  Holds nice and tight.  If you want to get out of it cheap (zero cost) you can use a rubber band I guess, but I wanted something that didn't quite look archaic. Wish they had some NEUTRAL colors, but not a big deal if your fitbit is hidden in a bra, pocket etc...

OTHER CON: if you take our fitbit out of the case a lot, these bands are TIGHT,and you have to wiggle and jiggle them off.  So it is one more thing to deal with.  I keep mine in the original silicone case, with one of these bands around it, and just pop it in a zippered wristband I got for it.  That wristband they send with the fitbit one really sucks (you lost the fitbit in bed after less than one week wearing it to bed!).  Get a zippered case and never have to remove the fitbit ONE from the silicone case again.

I purchased these on Amazon last week.  I like them, but the price is WHOLLY crazy for these. But did I pay it, YES, because I couldn't find anything like it.  So spent the money.",OR,0
"It assembles and breaks down into a single unit, which is a handy feature for the person who needs a pair of sunglasses. The goggles are also designed to be worn in a closed position so that they can be easily moved around without damaging the lenses.

The two-way mirror is a nice addition to my bike, especially if I can use the reflective lenses to reflect light into the sun. The lens is very thin and it is easy to hold with a pair of sunglasses. The glasses have a flexible outer shell that provides a good amount of light for cycling, which is nice for a beginner. I am happy with the quality of the product and would buy again.

The only downside I have is that I don't like the color of the lenses. I have had no problems with them being scratched, but I would have liked a better color.

I picked this up for my 9 year old who loves playing baseball. Is he the best player on his team? No. He wants so badly to play shortstop, but isn't the best fielder. He was getting discouraged about always playing in the outfield. He has improved with team practices, but really has no one to help him to practice at home. This net has been amazing because he can go out by himself and throw and catch the ball for HOURS by himself. In a few short days he has already improved his fielding skills and is eager to show them off to coach before his next game.

It was incredibly easy to put together. All the pieces are labeled ON THE ACTUAL PIECE, so once you take it out of the plastic you can STILL identify it exactly which piece it is. One piece had the ""snap"" on the wrong side so it's not exactly ""snapped"" into place, but it still holds. I double checked the instructions and it just looks like I got a wacky piece.  The net goes on easy. Once you get a rhythm down it's easy to snap on without pinching any fingers, but still be careful.

The instructions also include instructions on where to throw the ball for which types of rebounds.

As amazing as this product is, I only rated it 4 stars for because of the wonky piece that doesn't snap and because it's not very compact making storage an issue. The kick stand is the only thing that folds (which keeps the net nice and tight.) This is something you will need a large space to store as it is large and wavy. We will be storing our in our garage against the wall. It's no big deal, really, but I know some want small and portable--but this isn't it.

A compact adapter that converts a USB C to a USB A.  These very thin laptops are too small for an optical drive.  Mine has two USB A ports and a USB C port.  The BluRay drive requires BOTH of the USB A ports to function.  Another lack on the laptop brcause of dimensions is there is no Ethernet port.  My Ethernet adapter is USB A.  I use the Aukey adapter to connect the Ethernet adapter to the USB C port.  Next I will find out whether a USB multiple output block will run satisfactorily with several USB devices connected.,OR,0
"UPDATED REVIEW (2 YEARS LATER):
Only recommend this product if you're going to lay it flat on the floor. If you're trying to stick to a wall, forget about it. It WILL not stay.

Very solid and well-made product. Took some getting used to stuffing speaker cable inside. I used the entire length and didn't need to cut into. Worked out very nicely after all was said and done. The double-side tape took a minute to get the backing off, but once I did, it was SUPER STRONG. Hopefully, it stays stuck to my tile flooring and I never have to worry about unsightly cables again. Much thicker than I had anticipated.",OR,0

"admittedly, this camera is very inexpensive for the feature set you get. but we needed to change batteries far too often to make this a worthwhile investment. Also the lack of optical zoom means you are essentially buying a 35 mm point and shoot, so great if that's what you want (and u r willing to spend $10/week on batteries for regular ""vacation"" usage). IF you want greater flexibility, and something u won't grow out of or tired of real fast, u should keep looking for something that may involve extra initially, but you will get more use of.

Juiced Systems Extra Long Charging Cable.

The monitor's wide-screen real estate makes editing hundreds of photos quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also uses less power and produces less heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis.""

Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speakers are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers.

"5 stars for customer service! Like many other reviewers on this product, the battery from Anker lasts about 7-8 months before the battery starts to swell up and making the mouse track un-clickable and the battery drains out in under 35 minutes. I contacted AnkerDirect recently through their seller page and told them about my battery issue. They asked for pics of the the battery and sent me a return label to mail in the old battery for a replacement covered under the warranty. Easy Peasy. If only all companies were this awesome. I would deal with AnkerDirect again in a heartbeat.

Now for the product itself...4 stars. I have a mid 2010 macbook, and its basically been hanging onto its electronic life by a thread. When I had to replace the original battery that came with my macbook, I didn't want to invest in a Apple battery because I wanted to only squeeze out another 18 months with my mac before upgrading to a new laptop. So this was the way to go for me, especially with the warranty. After installing, it worked great and held a charge for a good 2-3.5 hours depending on how many apps/windows were open until around the 7 month of use. If purchasing this battery keep in mind that there is a chance that you will have to replace it within a year through the warranty. If it's not a big deal to you, don't hesitate and get this battery.",OR,0
"I really wanted to love this camera.  But the noise levels and expensive lens selection wouldn't allow me to keep it.
I literally liked this camera so much I almost considered buying the meta bones speed booster adapter so I could use faster lenses from Nikon or Canon, but then I realized I'm getting into the higher end price range of cameras with much better sensors.  It was SO close, but not usable for me beyond a hobby camera.

With the poor battery life, had to buy lots of extra batteries. Seriously, if you want to film 4k video for wedding work you will need about ten batteries.
With poor noise / image quality (spend way too much time in post production)
With poor button layout (spend more time fiddling with buttons, less time taking pictures)

Pros:
- PRICE (wow at this price I would buy 3 of these)
- SIZE (fits in any bag)
- WEIGHT -- Light weight
- AUTO FOCUS -- Great auto focus
- STABILIZATION FOR PHOTOS -- Has Dual Stabilization for still photos (in camera + lens)
- COLOR -- Great color
- SCREEN -- tilts, swivel, touch screen, multi-touch. It's perfect!!
- Viewfinder -- best viewfinder I've ever used in my life!!!

Cons
- BUTTONS Physical button layout is terrible. (ISO, Shutter speed, F-stop should be together)
- STABILIZATION No Dual Stabilization for video (in camera + lens)
- BATTERY LIFE is horrible (you will need 3-4 batteries to compare to 1 DLSR battery)
- RAW FILES -- have to use Adobe DNG converter to edit raw files.  Very annoying.",OR,0
"A fair monitor for function, and an easy to use interface.

The only drawback is the extra cord that comes with the monitor, which is not provided with the monitor.  This is a minor issue, and will be a problem for others.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for my TV. I did not want to have to replace it since the new one broke. I went with the Amazon Easy TV and the new one was $30 cheaper than the old one. I wanted to be able to use my new TV, which I was unable to do since my previous one had a broken cable. This TV was a great deal. I bought it for the new one because I have the new one to replace. It is a great product.

"I am very familiar with Carson, having owned a couple binoculars with HD glass. I used
those for surveillance work and for birding. One pair broke and they replaced them without
any questions. I very much appreciate the company. As for this monocular, I shopped around and looked at several and was about to pay a lot more
for a premium monocular when I decided that I didn't need it. I gambled on this unit, hoping
that I would not need the better glass of a more expensive one. It's a bit large, but I have
large hands. It isn't the easiest to focus with, but you become fairly adept at it quickly
enough. The quality seems good and I imagine that I will have this unit around for a long time. I teach firearms indoors and I needed a monocular to help my aging eyes see the. 22 caliber bullet
holes on black targets with dark backgrounds. I can readily see holes out to 20 yards with these
and I am very happy, especially at the pricepoint. I carry them in my jacket pocket for birding
when riding my motorcycle. Hech, I even tried the ant thing and it was impressive that I could
stand above an ant pile and watch them as if I was on my knees, like when I was a kid. I recommend this monocular and I promise you that you will like Carson as a brand, especially if
you have to contact them. I just wish that they would make a nice birding spotting scope. Regards and happy viewing.",OR,0
"I'm commenting here only about a belated experience to remark about the resiliency of this unit to water. In an attempt to move my jacket out of the way in boarding a kayak in fresh water (Rainbow River, Fl), one of the pockets of the gore-tex jacket accidentally hung out of the craft (unbeknowngs to me) when my partner sitting behind me said ""one of your pockets is in the water"". Yep, it had the Canon camera in it; it had been submerged inside the pocket for about a full minute (perhaps longer), but the pocket hadn't pooled with water, only was wet inside. Needless to say, it appeared to be a goner. The viewfinder had beads of water inside, and the screen inside showed condensation and water droplets. Also, the battery compartment had some water in it, but not pooled, but enough that I could pour out several drops from it. I removed the batteries, and over a period of about 60 hours, exposed the camera to sunlight on the dashboard and inside the glove compartment to dry out. It gradually dissapated the droplets inside the viewfinder, and the condensation from the inside screen disappeared. Only at that time did I attempt to turn it on. I couldn't believe it! The 4GB SD card was intact with the pics, and the motor successfully retracted the lens. A few trial pics confirmed that the camera is now back in working order. Call it luck, but patience prevailed in letting natural sunlight and warmth bring it back to life. I'm impressed with this experience.",OR,0
"I'm not usually a traditional web designer, but I decided to try this one for the first time. I had a lot of trouble with the basic design of the keyboard, especially the color. I tried the color on a white background and it was very disappointing. I would have preferred a more vibrant color with a tactile feel, but the color was not there. It was also very difficult to set up with the touch screen. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is that it was very easy to forget to turn on the touch screen when typing on it, which is a big problem with this keyboard. I do recommend it for anyone who wants a simple keyboard for their work. I have been using a gb 3x2 for over a year and have had no problems. This is my second gb 3x2 and I use it in the past and have had no problems with the addition of a screen protector. I use this with a Canon 5D Mark II and this has worked great for me. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good gb 3x2. I bought this keyboard for my daughter and she loves it. It's a little smaller than the typical gb keyboard, but it's perfect for her needs. It works perfectly in my office and she loves it.",CG,1
"This case is lightweight, feels good in the hands, and installation is as easy as described; just push the iPad gently into the inside and listen for the snaps.  Thats about all the good I can actually think of for this product, however.

This case's advertising is very, very misleading.  The description states that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality.  What it actually does is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever.  When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnets in the corners of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratches while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type cases provide.  I was sorely mistaken.

If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy.  If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promises to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid does not provide secure closure, this does not bode well for the iPad.

The only thing thats providing me ""secure closure"" in this transaction is that Amazon has a wonderful returns policy and I will be getting a full refund for the item so that way I can find an iPad portfolio case that does work as it should.",OR,0
"A quick explanation of the title. I have severe to profound loss of hearing in the mid to high frequency range and my Sharp LC60LE835U become just about unintelligible with its poor speakers (wonderful picture). Was looking to go CC but, after reading the reports of soundbars, decided to try one last thing. Had a 5:1 Bose system whose speaker system couldn't easily be connected after moving into a new home. It came down to the Sony CT-150 and the Yamaha ATS 1010 (from Costco). The decision was made after reading that I could use my powered sub-woofer with the Yamaha, plus its great glossy black looks matched the TV, blueray (& Cisco VCR .. to some extent).
Real simple optical connection from TV, and wow! ... I could now hear with clarity, from movies to TV series. I replayed a couple of TV shows & movies that I had previously had real difficult time in understanding, and now had a whole different audio experience. A boon for baby boomers for sure.
Now for the short list of cons, not deal breakers but folks should be aware of them. The built-in sub-woofer is simply not up to the job - get an external unit to really appreciate the bass (especially in movies).  The surround sound is not wondrous, and to advertise it as a 7:1 experience is just plain deceptive. Yamaha should get real with its claims about this aspect. However, I would imagine this unit is just about there with others in this class and no-one in their right minds can really expect a decent surround sound from a soundbar.
To conclude, the Yamaha far exceeded my expectations in uplifting my TV experience - if you have similar hearing loss, just give this a try.",OR,0
"This purchase was a nice replacement for my older Garmin nuvi 350.  I paid about $120 on sale for this unit and paid nearly $300 for the older nuvi 350.  For starters, the free Lifetime update was very nice.  For my Garmin nuvi 350, I had to purchase the map updates card for about $95.  The screen on this unit is thinner and a little larger.  I was pleased to discover the a/c vent attached mount my daughter bought years ago still works with this Garmin.  I can't yet tell if the Traffic feature is available in my area, at least I haven't been rerouted yet.  I do like that this model tells you roughly what lane to be in for a turn or exit coming up.  I could see where that would be helpful driving in areas like California.  The feature that provides your traveling speed in the lower left is kind of annoying.  I don't know why I would use that if I have a working speedometer and it's not that accurate.  I think I can change that to display the distance to the destination. It boots up faster and does a better job of detecting the satellites. I'm very pleased with it and think it was a terrific value for the money.

I put the older Garmin nuvi 350 in the kids' car.  Utah commonly has addresses like 348 East 500 North. Addresses are indexed from the center of each town.  Once the teenagers figured out that Garmin just wants the 348 for the address and 500 for the street, which then gives you options to choose 500 North or 500 South, they use it whenever driving to someplace new.",OR,0

"I wanted to revitalize my early 2011 MacBook Pro.  The drive itself works mostly as expected (about 12% slower than its specs).  But the installation was arduous and can be expensive.

First, the drive is formatted for Windows and all the software provided is Windows only.  So you need to use Disk Manager to erase the disk, rename it to something meaningful, and reformat it to Mac OS Extended Journaled.  Then you need a piece of software like Carbon Copy Cloner to mirror your existing hard disk onto the new SSD.  CCC is a great software package, which you should probably own anyway for various backup tasks, but if you don't already have it, buying it adds to the expense of the upgrade.

The provided installation guide is a pamphlet of 8 pictures for installing on a desktop, 6 pictures for installing on a laptop, and 1 frame of cautions.  All very generic and useless for my MacBook Pro.  By the way, both sets of pictures show a SATA-to-USB adapter cable for cloning, which was not included and must be purchased separately.

The installation requires a 7mm to 9.5mm space adapter for 2.5 drives.  Again this is an additional purchase as the Samsung SSD is more shallow than the original drive.  The actual physical installation involves removing the cover, removing the drive clamp and old drive, removing the 4 stud screws on the old drive and putting them onto the SSD, applying the spacer (be sure to orient the drive to the cable connector before adhering it), seating the drive (it still seemed a little loose), re-installing the drive clamp and replacing the cover.  The studs are required on the new drive to make sure it seats into the clamp.  Why Samsung couldn't spend an extra $.0005 and include these on the SSD is unknown.

So, overall 4 stars for the drive, 0 stars for the lack of Mac installation support and the required accessory expenses, averaging out to 2 stars for this review.",OR,0

Seen it before? Yep! Clooney (Danny Ocean), yet in another ex-convict role (remember ""O, Brother...""?), leads a gang of eleven experts to rob three Las Vegas casinos. Sounds like a familiar plot? Perhaps, but Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh manages to pull off a movie that's very entertaining. Not that it's in any way related to the plot of the 1992 movie, but it reminded me of the movie ""Sneakers"" where Robert Redford gathered a group of experts as well...

"I Compare this movie to inception because tht was the last sci-fi action movie I saw that was better than I was expecting (and I was expecting a lot). This is a solid adult sci-fi flick. The first act of the film is intriguing and shows a lot of promise. It plays out a little slower more in a drama fashion or the middle third of the film. And the third act is not as satisfying as it could have been.

As a reviewer on Rottentomatoes mentioned, this is like a mashup of other classic sci-fi films. Terminator, 12 Monkeys and Firestarter immediately spring to mind. It's a good movie, do not get me wrong, but I would go with low expectations and you might find that there are some interesting concepts at play (poor Seth).

You do not have tell a lie when you do not have to say something. In the movie it considers you have to say what you are thinking. It is not real.

I was already familiar with the material prior to viewing this movie as I have read many, many books on the topic, but Naughton uses fabulous visuals that help to elucidate the finer points and clarify some of the muddier issues. Make no mistake, Tom Naughton is super smart as well as funny, and he has solicited the help of some of the best minds in the field of nutrition and medicine to show the public where Morgan Spurlock went horribly wrong in his conclusions.

"The World's End is a well-written action, middle-age life crisis, dark humored meets sci-fi film. The actors bring characters to life, making them believable. Like life, people aren't always what they seem; it's during crises that one's mettle is tested and who we are as human beings really revealed.

The movie isn't exactly what I thought it was going to be about, but was NOT disappointing in even a small dose! My teenagers caught some of the little ""pieces"" that relate to Simon Pegg's & Nick Frost's two previous films (""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz""), which sometimes only consisted of, say, a piece of wrapper.

The Special Features were enjoyable to watch. Seeing the actors not in character as they talked about the writing of the film, what their vision was, and how it came about was fun.

I'll not write a summary of the movie-- you can get that anywhere. But the summary of our family's view of this film: We loved it!

"In her directorial debut, 27-year-old writer/director Gia Coppola recalls her niece, Sofia, more than her grandfather, Francis Ford.  The film, Palo Alto, based on short stories by co-star James Franco, is an anxious daydream of a film chronicling the coming of age of a few troubled teenagers in the titular Northern California city.  Among them is the smart, yet shy April (Emma Roberts), who engages in inappropriate flirtation with her older soccer coach, played by Franco.  The film is not defined by a sense of propulsion, but rather its sincerity, its concern for its characters' ethical conundrums, and a general air of authentic melancholy.  Everyone delivers a capable performance without overshadowing the other members of the ensemble; after years in the spotlight, this is far and away Roberts' most engaging and relaxed turn.  There are a few questionable storytelling and stylistic decisionsa disturbing house-party gang rape is related as an afterthought via almost wistful voice-overand the film is never as beautiful, moving, or sensual as the masterful The Virgin Suicides (a hard comparison to avoid), but the latest-to-the-game Coppola otherwise acquits herself nicely, confidently drawing the audience into the private lives and longings of the adolescent characters.",OR,0
"Fright fans, rejoice: thrills have been found again.

""Tales of the Dead: Grim Stories of Curses, Horror and Gore"" is an exploration of suspense. Divided into four vignettes, the film offers a variety of Halloween pleasures--each certain to impress those craving more than the standard cinema fare.

In this meet of multiple genres (each story chronicles a different element of horror, from the paranormal to the all too real) viewers will be offered a relentless pace and satisfying conclusions. The film does not falter as it changes tones and characters. It instead generates intrigue. This marks it unique among the typical plots. There are no tedious interludes or wasted moments. There is instead simply tension. It allows each individual to remain captivated; and this is a rarity.

What is not so rare, however, is the one flaw ""Tales of the Dead"" bears: its special effects. Like so many of its kind the film is limited by a too tiny budget. This forces occasionally laughable results and poorly constructed attempts at terror.

Those attempts are not enough to ruin the experience, however. While they may cause the viewer a momentary regret, they will still be countered by efficient storytelling and convincing acting--which offers far more than mere effects.",OR,0
"Imagine taking reality TV, Star Trek, and the movie ""Planet of the Apes"" to the extreme is an insult to the people of America and the world we live in.  This movie is a sad and depressing movie.  The only reason I watched it is to see how the people of America were treated by the media and the movie industry.  If you haven't seen this movie, you're probably not even aware of it.  It's like a crime drama, except that it's not about a crime, it's about a human being who is actually put through hell.  This movie is a waste of time and money.  It's just not worth watching.  I'll buy this movie to watch again.I loved this movie. It was a good movie and I was impressed with the story. It was not the best of the bunch.

"After watching  a couple episodes of ""An Idiot Abroad,"" I had trouble sleeping because of the suffering of this man.  The look on his face as he looked up at his would be captors showed a level of fear, confusion and pain which I found to be unbearable to see.  Having watched ""Extras,"" it seemed impossible to believe that Ricky Gervais would deliberately cause a person to be sick, hungry, sleepless and afraid.
  At the beginning of the episode where Karl is in China, Karl says ""is he havin a laugh? and I thought that perhaps Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington are `avin a laugh"" on us and that this was a deliberate reference to ""Extras."".  I hope that is the case.  This would mean that the viewers are shown to be the sadists that those who made the show suspected they would be.  I also began to doubt that Karl is the childlike person he is portrayed as being because although childlike people say funny things at times, they tend not so say funny things continuously. Also, Karl Pilkington makes no funny comments about a man whose face is deformed.  Perhaps Karl Pilkington is a very clever man who is good at keeping a straight face.",OR,0

"Not everyone falls in love with an island.  But I did.  The best part of the film is the crew's ability to both enjoy and wonder if the island is really there.  They both look at the land in a way that makes it seem like it's there.  They both realize that they are the most beautiful people on the island and that the island has all of the qualities that make it beautiful.  But the film is shot with a camera that is better than anything else in terms of sound, color, and camera angles.  The colors are just gorgeous.  And it's a beautiful film that doesn't fall into the ""dark"" category.  The reason I like this film is because it has such an amazing cast.  It's also a film that was made to show people the beauty of the island.  I never saw this film before and I was really not expecting that.  It's a great film.

"Two of Jack Nicholson's best ever tantrum scenes
If you've seen this movie, you probably know what I'm talking about. There's one scene in which Nicholson REALLY doesn't want to invite his ditsy girlfriend (Karen Black) to come along to the family home to visit his dying father - and when he realizes he can't get out of it, he sits in his car and comes unglued. Then he get out, goes back inside and very calmly says, ""Rayette, you wanna come with me?""
The other one is in a roadside caf when the laconic waitress won't alter the menu selections by one jot - and again he comes unglued as only Nicholson can do when he's at the top of his performance, which he usually is.
But the rest of this movie is dark, dark, dark - a mood piece of a dysfunctional family. Nicholson plays a wounded outcast, a former piano prodigy who has been estranged from his father for years, spending his time as an oil worker in Texas, shacking up with his annoying girlfriend. When he learns his father is dying in Washington State, he sets off for 'home.' Most of the rest of the film is an odyssey, a road trip back to the family mansion and all he's left behind: his attachments, his family, his problems, his fears, and his failures.
Five Easy Pieces became a classic almost as soon as it was released. Don't miss it.",OR,0
"For SyFy, this isn't worse than anyother tripe they put out. It's got Ving Rhames and Lesley-Ann Brandt is pretty kickass. With one exception, the cast is actually pretty good. Which leads us to-Taryn Manning. She has to be the WORST actress in the history of zombie films. She can't act her way out of a paperbag. Her character, Romona was also the most useless character I have ever seen in a movie. She gives ""too stupid to live"" a whole new meaning. Her friend is being murdered, what does she do? RUN AWAY and yell at everyone else because they didn't save him! The special effects are sub-par, but I kind of expected that. There were a few major errors that would have been cheap and made things look more realistic, but they producers were obviously too lazy to figure out. For instance Henry kills a zombie with a chainsaw, then right after he stands there holding the chainsaw and you can clearly see THERE IS NO CHAIN on it! How hard would have been to use a fake prop chain or put a chain on after the ""kill"". The film moves along fine until the end and SPOILER alert: there are not one but TWO freaky, fake as f@!& looking zombie tigers at the dock. It was like they didn't know how to end the movie, so they just started throwing crap out there to see what would stick.",OR,0
"I have other ""drive-in"" tapes from Madacy and am quite happy with them. TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE sounded intriguing, and the price was right. I was all set to lambast this film, until I read the other reviews and was informed that there was footage missing. I love 50's trash horror, bad acting, etc. , but I wasn't prepared to be as bored as I was. I guess I don't equate bad acting with sleepwalking. And what was with that overlong deal with the dancer on the beach? Suddenly, it was over. On came a Betty Boop cartoon. I thought OH JOY! The cartoon wasn't even that good, though Ms. Boop showed maximum cleavage and overt sexiness, apparently before she ran into trouble with the Hayes code (1932). Surprise! The second film, NIGHTMARE CASTLE was blessedly interesting. Directed by Allan Gruenewald (real name: Mario Caiano) and starring the wonderfully confident Barbara Steele, we have here a film of great style, if not substance. Though poorly dubbed, fans of this genre don't really care. I didn't. Lotsa schlock & silly stuff entertained. Upon further investigation, I was interested to find out that TRACK was actually pasted together with footage from a Yugoslavian film and originally released by AIP as BLOOD BATH. Forget this version of TRACK, but CASTLE is definitely worth a look. Quality of print is also questionable. Madacy did a much better job with BLOOD CREATURE/WEREWOLF IN A GIRLS' DORMITORY.",OR,0
"What irked me more about this movie was the fact that the opening credits didn't play as smoothly.

I had to watch the movie to get the words ""good"" and ""bad"" to play in the movie. I am a movie buff. This is a great movie for the whole family. I have to admit I had a hard time adjusting to it.

"This movie is unfortunately different from the book as others have detailed.  For myself, I found that key Christian symbolism (the purpose of these stories) was removed, and in its place is far too much emphasis on a statement from Aslan that things never happen the same way twice.  Beyond having no great meaning, ironically, the scene occurs twice, with Aslan saying the same thing twice about things not happening the same way twice.  Worthless.  Where is the emphasis on Nikabrik's disbelief in the Narnians' tales of a savior, and where is the emphasis on the faith of Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter in a savior that lived many years ago who not only died but lived again and will return?  Their dialogue should have been the highlight of the film as it was for me in the book.

Incidentally, who else hated the repeated nauseating Reepicheep jokes?  ""You're a mouse!!""  Ugh.  They ruined such a great character.  But there are too many complaints about this film to list them all.

I intend to own the version of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from the same series.  I was so pleased with its faithfulness to the novel, and I looked forward to seeing the other books adapted. However, despite the good things they did in Prince Caspian, overall it was too disappointing to watch again, and I have no desire to watch The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.",OR,0
"I went and saw this in theaters and then bought the DVD and i have to say it is a awesome movie full of action and suspenseful moments. Then lets not forget Paula Patton in a dress that will make the eyes on any guy widen while he utters the word WOW! I still nearly drool at that point in the movie. MI Ghost Protocol is by a long shot the best of the series so far. The mix of suspense, thrill, action and stunts will leave even your most demanding action junkie pleased. This is not a film that will leave much of a long standing mental impression on you, which means you won't walk out of it with a changed view on life. Then again not many action movies will change your view on life. It won't make you do much thinking like other fairly recent films like Inception but then if you use Inception as your baseline for what you like then you will find yourself displeased with movies quite often. Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is still a awesome movie that has a good plot for a action movie, good action/stunts, and the action was really good. The plot is simple like many action movies but the on-screen things like action and dialog make up for it. Then the car  with a Heads Up Display is in one word is awesome...

4/5 Stars Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes action movies.",OR,0
"McQuarrie is clearly a movie junkie.  This is evident by his Peckinpah-esque story arc and settings and his pair of anti-heroes; the John Woo-esque excessive gunplay, the subsequent and frequent showers of bullets, and the limitless supply of people to kill, and guns to kill them with; and the Quentin Tarantino-esque self-conscious subversion of the genre.  I didn't mind all his overt nods/homages/rip-offs (whatever) because it still made for a heady mix that was fun, albeit a little too violent for my tastes.  Even the slow, slow-speed car chase, the failed-but-then-successful kidnapping attempt, and the cell-phone bit were fun although it's clear that McQuarrie is too conscious of the trademarks/cliches set down by his predecessors and is trying his darnedest to put a fresh spin on things.  But what weren't fun for me were the complex turns the plot took about halfway through the film.  Last week, I saw another overplotted film, ""Nurse Betty"", and I forgave the turns in that plot because LaBute dutifully made sure each of them paid off (although not all of them worked).  Here, the complications get piled on top of one another for no reason, and some are left to dangle without ever being resolved or even referred to again.  In McQuarrie's defence, I did get the feeling that many of the needless plot devices were meant to set up that final line of dialogue.  But even if that's the case, it's still not worth it because it wasn't THAT funny.",OR,0

The script and directing have been superbly executed, and the story is well told. The acting is strong, and the performances are always excellent.

"I prefer realism over Hollywood story telling.  This film is a great ""Popcorn"" type of War Movie, that in a way reminds me of the old 40's war movies.  The plot centers around a tank crew led by Brad Pitt's character ""WarDaddy""  (right away, when I see a War film with the characters all having nicknames, I know I am in for less than realism and more Hollywoodism).

There's a lot to like about this film.  It is entertaining, the sound effects are awesome (LOVE LOVE LOVE the .50 cal firing), there's suspense, tension, and afront to innocence brought into a combat scenario.

The tactics, movement, command and control structure, and even discipline are all Hollywood screen writers (by that I mean, they are not realistic, but written for the screen to be entertaining).  The combat is intense, although a bit too contrived.  I think actual combat would've seen the engagements they depict not turn out as depicted.

Still, I feel this film is worthy of 4 stars (the only reason I didn't go 5 is because of the realism factor)... I don't feel at all like I wasted my money.

I haven't addressed a story synopsis or plot lines because, to be quite honest, I don't want to spoil your viewing (if you've not seen it), and if you have, you know those speak for themselves.

I highly recommend this film if you're looking for a really really good war film that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Just don't expect the same level of immersion as other films, such as Platoon, or Saving Pvt. Ryan...  I don't think that was the filmakers' aim in making this.",OR,0

"Any of those who would dismiss this movie for its allegedly senseless violence or because they feel it's a pale imitation of Pulp Fiction simply do not understand Mexican culture.  Violence, verbal or physical, proliferates in Mexican culture; I think many of the reviewers (mostly overly sensitive gringos, I would gather) who are uncomfortable with this movie would probably be equally uncomfortable with the Mexican view of life inherited from the Spaniards--i.e., the fatalism, the grim resignation to the frequent ugliness and brutality of life, and a sort of crude vivacity.  Pienso que estas personas que no les gusta Mxico no tienen cojones.  But then again, most people want illusion not reality at the movies, which brings up the next point.
As for the Pulp Fiction charge, this movie bears about as much relation to that movie as Picasso, in his early, rough stage, does to Andy Warhol's soup cans.  In Amores Perros, the violence, and, hence, the feeling, is real; in Pulp Fiction, it's trendy posing.  We cringe at the gore and we giggle at the jokes, then we forget the whole pop culture souffl Tarantino has served up.  The people in Amores Perros are blood and guts--crude, yes, and occassionally ugly, but there's no doubt they're the real thing.  Quentin Tarantino has never delved this deeply.
I give this movie four stars instead of five because it's still at times subject to a youthful impetuousness that fits the first story beautifully but not the other two.  It's not quite great, but it's still mighty impressive.  And the middle story about the model losing her leg and enduring a romantic crisis with her lover is in the end rather tiresome--it's undeniably felt by the actors, but it seems like tawdry bourgeois angst or an episode from a melodramatic telenovela next to the urban blight and horrors of the first and third stories.",OR,0

You simply attach one to each corner of the picture, remove the stickers on the back and then place on the desired spot on your wall and apply pressure for a few minutes. Be sure to have your wall marked out beforehand to ensure the picture doesnt go on wonky

If I can install it successfully, ANYONE can.  I had more trouble getting my crusty 15-year old lock off than I did installing this one.

There is one thing that should be pointed out - when you test the ""keyless"" lock operation, it gives you a few seconds to change your mind before actually engaging the lock - so when you install this and then test out that feature, it can seem as though the lock is not locking if you IMMEDIATELY turn it back to ""test"" it - you have to lock, then wait a couple of seconds.",OR,0

I think I had it turned to the brightest setting for about 2 1/2 hours using the inexpensive alkaline batteries you get a Horror Freight before the light dimmed too much to continue.  The headband is comfortable enough that I forget that I am wearing it while working.  The ability to tilt the light is very nice because the beam pattern is pretty tight, and it would be tiring to move your neck to get the light where you want it.  I would recommend this light to a friend that needs it occasionally (once a week or less).",OR,0
The lights were fairly easy to install and the materials are good.  The light is bright and the light output is very bright.  I also like the fact that the light output is adjustable.  I have been using this in a multi-room house with 4 bedrooms.  The light output is about 8 watts.  I also like the fact that it is a single color.  I just installed it with the wire stripper and it works great.  I would recommend this light for any home or work where the color temperature is desired.  I would also recommend this light for a small work area where it is useful for some decorative purposes.  I have bought a lot of different types of lights and this one does the job perfectly.  I have a large cabinet with a variety of LED's and this one is very useful for any of those areas.,CG,1

"I am not particularly tech savvy.  I have ADT house automation with several of my lights controlled by their devices which work just fine.  I thought this may be a cheaper alternative.  It was!  I connected the hub to an ethernet outlet (instead of wireless).  It took a few minutes and it was ready to go.  I downloaded the app and went to every light switch (I had already installed 3 plus 3 remotes) and synched them using with them one by one.  I took seconds for each.  They showed up on the app as light switches that can be dimmed.  The range of the hub is really good.  I have the hub on the second floor and and the 2 of the switches are in the basement.  Overall, I could not be happier.  It all works so well and so far without a glitch.

I don't know what else to add.  It works and its easy to set up.  I just ordered six more switches.  Its kinda fun to spook people at my home when I am travelling!",OR,0

"As far as shower heads go this one works well.  I replaced just a stock circular shower head, and I would say this has as much water pressure as before, enough to get the shampoo and what not out of your hair, however, I do switch on the 'full blast' setting when rinsing my hair just to give it a reason for existing.  I'm concerned about other reviews that say the toggle for this setting will eventually blow out within 6-12 months.  I guess we'll see.  It won't be the end of the world as I'll then get to test some of the other shower heads I was looking at before deciding on this one :D.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading.",OR,0
"This is my first Super Tinker after using up 2 Tinkers and a couple of others. I'm a mechanic and general tinkerer and very hard on knives. The standard Tinker is nice and light and thin, but I found myself missing the scissors and went for this after finally destroying my last Tinker (abuse - my fault). The Super is not much larger than the Tinker, but I wouldn't keep either loose in my pocket for long. I find hanging them in my pocket from a key ring/belt clip saves my clothing and makes it harder to lose the knife.
  These knives are incredibly useful as a mini tool kit. I use the screwdrivers constantly, the awl makes a great drill, and the blades hold an edge pretty well. I often use the tweezers for removing splinters and deer ticks. It takes a substantial amount of force to break these knives (I figured out how much). So far I haven't used the scissors very often, but they are well made and work well.
  The toothpick is rather goofy, but I guess it's traditional to have one. The parcel hook has been useless so far, and I'd have preferred a file or something else. That said, I can't imagine not carrying a Swiss Army knife, and it's sad to have to leave it home sometimes because of increased security screening in some locations. Such is modern life.",OR,0

"How many times do you find yourself in the kitchen with a sharp knife and an unprotected hand?  I can tell you I've got lovely scars from the times I've cut myself slicing a bagel or some other awkward item.  I no longer have a problem with cutting myself now that I have a pair of NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves.

The first thing that I did when I put my cut resistant gloves on was to run a knife across my hand.  I used a very sharp Chefcoo knife and it didn't pop even one thread.

I received a pair of large NoCry gloves, because I have large hands.  I found that they fit my hands perfectly without added gaps or sag.  My 21 year old son, who happens to be 6'5"", was not able to get his hand into a glove because his hand was so large.

The NoCry cut resistant gloves are made from a food grade, non-toxic material and with cutting-edge silica-based fibers and are completely machine washable.  I found that I still had full use of my hands and I didn't lose any sensitivity in my grip or handling.

I already appreciate having my pair of NoCry cut resistant gloves in my kitchen to protect my hands and the hands of my loved ones.  You'll love having a pair in your kitchen too.

It is a very durable tool.  The saw does a good job of holding and holding the strip in place.  It has a very smooth cut and the saw is very sharp.  I would recommend this saw for anyone.I really like these. They are great for taking a shower. They are very bright and they are very small. They fit my shower head perfectly.

"Holy COW!  IT WORKS!!!  Nothing sticks to Tarps, EVER, and it never ever lasts, but someone made a deal for their soul and behold!  We have TARP TAPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Truthfully, here is my story.

I like Burning Man because the climate tries to kill you (and other reasons.)  A HUGE, CRAZY STORM CAME AND FILLETED MY SHELTER!!  It struck from three directions and damaged every single tent in its vicinity, toppled pop-up campers and shredded the mylar off the tarp base in my roof.  It knocked over entire rows of porta-potties and left me sleeping in my car for days because it filled my shelter with mud and the roof (a tarp) was split.

My conundrum was severe.  The restoration was going to have to happen, should I ever not sleep in my car again, and so I evaluated the tarp tape and hoped it would do the job.  I did a sloppy job of cleaning off the surfaces and I started reattaching the mylar to the tarp with the tarp tape.  I used sutures and long stretches of tape to repair the splits and make the roof look like a relative of Frankenstein.  I didn't think it would last one day, but it survived for two weeks in the desert, through another rain storm and many hot days.  It didn't peel.  It didn't bubble up under the sun or slide like some tapes will when they overheat.  It just held strong.

I'm in love.",OR,0
"Sweet knife. Fit and finish was spot on. blade was centered and strait in the handle when closed. Opening is smooth and easy. Lock up with liner lock is tight with no play in any direction. Pretty dang sharp out of the box. That being said, the edge is very fine and I rolled about a third of it over in the middle of the blade just dinking around the house with it to get used to it. A quick hone and a few strokes on the strop brought it back easily. I'll update stars and review after I get some time in on it out in the field.

It should be noted that this thing is pretty large for an EDC/utility knife. It's heavy for it's size as well, largely due to the solid stainless liners. The blade is broad, but the flat grind mitigates that a bunch.

Update - So, I've had this thing a while now and it's been a great blade. I would dock half a star if I could due to the blade having lost it's centering when folded. It now rubs a bit on the liner, though it's not enough to hinder the opening of the knife. I carry it daily and use it daily as well. I feel like I've done anything out of bounds to get the blade to off center like it has. I take care of my gear. That all being said, it's still reliable and a great performer. It holds the edge well and is easy to touch up in the field with my pocket hone. I still recommend this knife and have bought the Rat II and am waiting on a D2 version the the Rat I.

"Initial inspection out of the box. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver. I had to replace the driver with a different one, so it is not that big of a deal.

I'm glad I did. I like the design of this blade. I have to get the blade to come out of the box, but I don't want to be stuck with a box full of knives. This blade is the best I have used. I would recommend this blade to anyone. I really like these. They are very bright. I use them to light up a room and they are very good. I have been using them for several months now and I am very happy with them. I have used the adjustable dimmer switches in the kitchen to dim the lights in the kitchen.

It made his behavior much worse- he would throw temper tantrums and just lie down on the walk, refusing to get up. After many adjustments, he was still able to get the nose part off every time.

I took her to a large social event today where hundreds of children and parents were present-- the harness seemed to keep her from jumping up (something that she frequently does)  and I really liked the fact that when I did correct her for not heeling at my side she responded well from the harness pressure and I didn't feel like it was hurting her.  The product seems well made, but again I've only used it once. I was torn between ordering a s/m verses a med. She is currently 30 pounds and has a petite build. I ended up purchasing the medium.  When tightened all the way it fits her well-- a tad big but she is still growing.",OR,0
"Bought these about 2 years ago. The only problem is that they are too small for my dog. He's 8 lbs and I am a small dog, so I'm not sure if he'll be able to fit in the cage. If it's going to be a problem, I would recommend a size up for him.

I had to order a second cage so I could use it. It's about the same size as the one I was using at the time, but it's a bit bigger for him, so I will probably order a third.

I'm very happy with this purchase. I like that it's a good quality product. We bought a second cage for my dogs and now we're using the same cage for our own dogs. I've had no problems with the cage getting dirty, but I have no idea how",CG,1

He likes to play with it.  I have tried other chews, but this one does the trick.  I put it in a bag and it's gone.

I will definitely be buying this again!I have a Yorkie and a Yorkie mix, both of whom have some kind of sensitive stomach issues, and I wanted something that would allow them to eat something that would help them to not have a digestive issue.

"Love this harness. We have 3 bigs dogs that we walk regularly and before we switched to this harness and Halti double leads they pulled us around the block. We actually use the leads as ""anchors"". We strap the lead around our waist and connect the other end to the front clip of each dog's harness. We then use our old regular leads to clip to the harness right between the shoulder blades. I can't say they don't pull at all with these harnesses but it has decreased significantly. (It's our own fault because we haven't properly trained them to not pull, but who has time for that). Using the leads like this also gives us a much more control over them. It used to feel like they would pull my arm out of my socket but now when they do pull (if they see a cat or squirrel and they try to lunge) they are trying to pull against my whole body weight at my center of gravity and get no where fast. Definitely recommend this harness and the Halti double lead.",OR,0

"I have two cats - one who was OBSESSED with these treats and another who turned his nose up at these.  My cat who ate these was a consistent vomiter, and I always assumed it was hairball related.  However,  I started to notice that after she ate these treats, she seemed to throw up more.... I researched online and found 100s of people who reported that these treats made their cats ill to the point of death in some cases.  I immediately threw my treats away and alerted all the cat parents I knew of the potential risk.  I couldn't imagine losing my fur child to something so senseless!

After tossing these, my cat has had no vomiting incidents and has done just find without treats.  My cat who never liked these has never had any issues getting sick, which leads me to believe that these were negatively affecting the health of my cat.  We've kept their food the same otherwise, so this was the only variable that has changed.  If you must give these to your cat, please proceed with caution and keep an eye on their health.",OR,0
"this seemed like one of the more higher end dog food since it cost twice as much as the dog food I got the first time I got my shelter dog.. She's a terrier mix (my vet tells me terriers are picky with food? I'm not entirely sure being a first-time dog owner), so I'm trying out different dog food that she'll like.. I saw great rating on this dog food, so I tried giving it a go, but she barely eats any! She'll only eat about a quarter of a cup an entire day, and start eating the grass outside when I take her out... I fed her the indoor mini dog royal canin stuff before, and that one smelled much nicer like a can of tuna (which made her poop smell nicer) and she actually ate her portions when I gave that to her. I was just hoping if I was going to spend that much money on dog food, I might as well find her the best one for her, but this one is a total miss.

We got this for our dog to use as an on/off leash. It works great on him. He is a chewer. He's a medium-size dog and he loves this collar. It's easy to put on, holds the dog well, and is easy to use.

"I ordered this because I wanted something easier than the usual chicken carrot made from scratch cake that I usually make for the pup's birthday. It's definitely easy. Add the ingredients and stir. My oven was not working so I put it in a silicon bone shaped dish in the microwave for the 2 minutes it says on the box. The middle was still not cooked, I think I went all the way to 4 minutes and it still was not cooked in the middle, So I used a glass cot cut out the middle a little bigger than the uncooked part and put that back in the microwave for 1 minute and it finally got cooked. Put the middle back in and the dogs didn't mind at all. The icing was thin and the amount was small so I stretched it with some Greek yogurt, again, the dogs didn't mind. Since all this is silliness, it's up to you if you care about how it looks. The dogs when given permission eat every last crumb and they loved it. I might buy it again, this time I just had neck surgery and the oven was broke. Also I think it was the perfect size for my three golden retrievers - not too big so that I worried about how their stomachs would handle it, and everyone did fine there too.",OR,0

"Our 3 year old golden retriever has softer fur, unlike our female whose coat is shinier and sleeker, so he tends to need to be bathed on a weekly basis to keep him smelling fresh and clean. He's like a little boy, he loves to explore and especially loves to jump in every puddle, pond, any body of water he sees basically which leaves his fur smelling what can best be described as fishy so I'm always looking for a great shampoo that won't irritate his sensitive skin.  This medicated dog shampoo has done absolute wonders for the dry, flaky skin both our goldens have on their front elbows.  We had tried creams, sprays, even oral meds but nothing was helping but since we started using this the skin has softened and fur is growing back and they are no longer scratching themselves to death, thrilled with the results, highly recommend.  This item was supplied to me at no cost during a promotion by the seller in order to evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest & unbiased opinion.

"These bees are supposed to be replacements for the beehive toy, but these toys are great individually! Last year I bought my dog the chipmunks and the tree stump and wanted to get the chipmunks replacement this year, but they were $3 dollars more than these! If you watch the price it could go down to about $4.50. It's an awesome deal! Dog toys are expensive and these are made so well. My dog loves any thing with a squeaker and even though hes 14 pounds, he destroys every time I've given him except for these Kyjen chipmunk/bees etc. They're a great treat for dogs who love toys and they're economical since they last for a very long time! I definitely recommend them and I will buy them again as soon as they hit the four dollar mark ;)

edit jan 21st
sad to say, but I have to take down 2 star... these toys are awesome little things that my dog loves to throw in the air and catch, but the squeakers inside are horrible! The squeakers inside last about an hour, but they never squeak again... they're very poorly made. The squeaker inside has two parts and the little thing that makes the squeaker squeak always slides out. Then the squeaker part always gets smashed within an hour that my dog gets bored of it. That's the only problem with this toy which is kind of a big deal since the whole point is for it to squeak! Anyways they are very durable and if you just replace the squeaker, your dog will be able to enjoy this toy for a very long time :)",OR,0
"I want all of the guinea pig world to know these EZ whelp pads are awesome. This is so much better than fleece and totally cost effective. I have a large rabbit cage which is 17x40 and my piggies sleep in this at night and spend all day in a kiddie play pool with a fence around it...3 ft round. I was using carefresh bedding and  a litter box which my boars use about half the time for pee and some poo. The carefresh is odor absorbing but definitely dusty....then along comes whelping pads. WOW!!! I BOUGHT A 36 inch pad and put that in the bottom of the kiddie pool. Its soft and wonderful for piggie feet and I only need to take a little plastic sand shocel and scoop up any poops and place in the litter box. Pee is immediately absorbed and after a week still no smell.
I washed the pad in the washing machine on cold and dried on low heat, cones out like new. So I then got the slightly thicker paw print pads as poctured and one pad fits in the travel cage I have and 2 pads fit in their night home cage.
I just use my toy shovel each morning and its great. I was able to get carefresh bedding on sale so I use that only in the litter box.
Persobally these make the cages look neat and fresh and I think its better to not have as much paper bedding. Its cheaper than fleece and I think more absorbing.
Thanks to EZ whelp...piggies have a great new source for their home needs. Pics are of bog cage, travel cage, pig pool...and one of my boars.",OR,0

The story is fast paced and you never know what's going to be thrown at you next.  The story grabs you from page one to leaving you begging for more on the last. There is a little bit of everything tossed in and something that each type of Zombie lover can find appealing.

"Once an architectural historian, I have a weakness for books about architecture and/or renovation projects. So I had great hopes until I started reading this one. It was quickly apparent that the author knew very little about buying, renovating or even owning such a building, and since that was the scaffolding on which the story was to be told, the book lost my interest. There are good architecture books, by, for example, Lindsey Davis (a Roman villa in Britain) and Ellis Peters (a great cathedral). This isn't one of them.",OR,0

This was my first Ava book (I know, I know...start in the middle), so I didn't know how everything started, or what was going on most of the time, but I was having so much fun that I didn't care!  And for the record, I think I knew as much as Ava much of the time. LOL  I laughed hard at the hi-jinks.  I especially loved Ava's thoughts on goblin anatomy, and pretty much her thoughts on men in general.  I am definitely going back - or forward - for more in the series.

"My introduction to Sophia Henry and her Pilots series was through Power Play. Gaby and Landon had a meaty story but there was a disconnect for me. So I decided to try again with Interference. Ms. Henry is consistent in her willingness to tackle subjects that are painful. From the beginning she delivers that one, two punch. Complex people facing their demons and working to overcome them. Jason has baggage that has followed him into adulthood. From abandonment and trust issues, to an attraction that pulls the scab off a partially healed wound. Linden has worked to become a responsible young woman. An act of rebellion in her teens left her with more responsibility than she expected and the shame of disappointment. Interference redeemed Sophia Henry in my eyes. Sympathy, empathy and hope are the stepping stones to an amazing and inspirational story.",OR,0

There are some funny moments in the story, it does take awhile to build the story and some parts seen slow. The only thing I found confusing is the tense and point of view would sometimes change during a chapter or paragraph. Emmy seems a character and the secondary characters were as colorful. There was an undercurrent of a love story but enjoyed the twist. I will honestly say my review and eating is also based off the fact that there is supposed to be a second book.

There is natural character development, perfect story progression, and she delicately weaves the dark parts of the characters past with the light.

"Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  With each new book in the series, the characters are growing.  This book was different as it was based upon an attack of an Irish rugby hero who isn't dead but is comatose and is married to a well known and loved TV personality.  The mystery was trying to figure out who would want to hurt him and why.

Reilly, Chris and Kennedy struggle to figure it out through all the media hype involving the famous couple.  The forensics crew are working long hard hours going over all the evidence and coming up with very little to go on and a few unknowns...but they are all very intelligent in their own ways and eventually things slowly begin to come together.

In this story, you also get to see a different side of Reilly, as she tries to work through both her personal problems and her career problems.

This was an excellent read and I hope there are more to come ... and soon!  Thank you to the Hill's for this wonderful series,",OR,0
"Earth has been completely ravaged by disaster after disaster.  There are only a limited number of humans even left and all of those are protected by domed cities that keep out the devastating radiation.  Suddenly, these domes are failing or about to fail.  The only person who can save them is Eve who doesnt even know that she holds the secret to saving the human race.

Apocalypse Evolution was a good story.  Its definitely science fiction with a nice apocalyptic touch.  There were a few unbelievable parts, but in science fiction, you can have totally out there things that could/would happen in certain circumstances.

Bryces writing was tight and to the point.  There wasn't too much wasted time in this short story.  The comes at a slight fault, though, we really don't know much about Eve and her backstory other than that she is basically on borrowed time and being hunted. I think a little more into the who and why for her character would really catapult this short story into the great range.",OR,0

"This is book 5 in the Montana Born Brides series. The books in the series all take place in Marietta and the pending celebrity wedding of a local girl gone big time links them together. The neat fact is that the books in this series are written by different authors. I enjoyed Magdalena and Jake's story. We saw them both in previous books and we knew that Magdalena had returned home with her teenage daughter after being gone since she became pregnant as a teenager. She has been the topic of small town gossip because she has never revealed the name of her daughter's father. Jake is a famous country singer who is taking a break because he's lost his muse and is unable to write any new music. Although famous, Jake is down to earth and likable. Im not always a fan of love at first sight, but Jakes feelings for Magdalena are sincere and based upon not only her looks but her singing. This was a good book and a nice addition to the series.

"We finally get to know more about Nick and Lila. We know Nick is an a #1 jerk with a chip on his shoulder. We know he can play lead guitar like he was born with one in his hands but we don't know much about his family. In Shattered we learn that even though Nick's twin sister has a drug problem he would do most anything to help her and their dad. We learn about Nick's mom. Cari Quinn makes Nick likable, almost human. Lila is also made human. Even though she is referred to as the Dragon Lady she has problems just like everyone else and two of her biggest are Nick and her husband. One she wants and they other she wants rid of. We get to see where Lila came from and meet her parents in this book. What we do get in this book is a HEA. Sorry folks but it is a cliffhanger.

"Leigh develops the world surrounding music well, allowing those without the background to understand whats going on, while also not bogging down those who are already in the know.  The entire world is built in such a manner that you can easily follow the multiple different aspects of this well written novel.  Unfortunately I had a hard time fully getting into the story.

I enjoyed the characters in this novel.  Leigh has developed them in a multifaceted manner, allowing readers to get to know them on many levels.  There were times when I had a bit of difficulty merging them with their counterparts in the first novel of the series.  The major transformations and character shifts were a little drastic, but were also very well & easily explained by the current events surrounding the characters.

Although well written & enjoyable, I simply found this story difficult to fully get into.  I fully understand why others can & will thoroughly enjoy it, it wasn't my cup of tea.

"This is a quick, heated historical read about a young woman being pressured to marry the right man and a man with no title and no fortune who also happens to love her. Its short, sweet and has sexy moments, but there really isn't much more to it than that. Both characters have appeared briefly in the rest of the series and to be honest I didn't really learn much more about them in this book. Paul is quiet and honorable, Georgina feels trapped by the rules imposed on her and does her best to flout them where she can  which contradicts her previous behavior, where shes been much more prim and proper. If you're looking for a quick read with some Regency flair  including a fun historical outing to see Madame Tussaud's waxworks  and like a bit of sensual heat, then this will likely fit the bill. Certain things were resolved a little too easily for my liking, but that might have been thanks to the short length. Overall its a nice read that unites a couple of minor characters from the series.

"genre: paranormal romance
setting: contemporary
format: collection of short stories

The author's book description is so far off as to be false advertising. This is NOT a novel. This is a collection of short stories. I only read the first. If the author doesn't take the time to describe the ""freebie"" stories, I conclude the quality is too low to be worth my time. The first story supports this.

""Bearly Mended"" shows potential. He & she meet when she (a doctor) treats his wounds. What I liked best is the universe, which shows potential. The leading man's personality & behavior was well crafted. The grammar was pretty good, which is above most self published stories.

Alas, the problems are numerous. The plot is fragmented. The doctor's behavior is so unprofessional (what employer would put up with an employee just leaving mid-shift without notice?) and unrealistic (how did this doctor get avoid working in an emergency room as part of her training?) that she would be fired immediately. The lack of police involvement cannot be justified in a society where shifters are known citizens. The transition between chapters can be rough, sometimes feeling like the author accidentally erased a few chapters.

"Ceony thought that the danger was over. She saved the magician she was apprenticing and put an end to the threat. She didn't expect to be targeted for revenge for what she did. She also didn't expect to have to hide a budding relationship with her mentor from everybody around her.

I have to be very honest, when I first started reading this book, I was trying to figure out why there was a need for sequels. Then it all hit at once and I fell into the story without another thought. It may have a very slow start, but the buildup behind it is amazing!

The narrator was as amazing in this as she was the first book. I really adored her. I'd love to listen to more books by this narrator. The story was good itself, but she enhanced it even more and brought life to all of the characters.

I do recommend this book very strongly. However, I recommend that the reader read the first book before picking this book up. Many references are made to the first book that may cause a reader who didn't read it to be very confused and not as interested in the story as they would be if they read the first.",OR,0
"I finished Ambassador: Seeing Red, today. I loved this book.

Patty Jansen has done a remarkable world building job, building a complex interplanetary society structured around 'gamra,' with earth and humanity as we mostly know it, sitting on the periphery. Cory Wilson is earth's second ambassador to 'gamra' - but the first ambassador who actually understands the society he's about to be thrust into.

The politics, cultural differences and language differences are complex, but well developed and understandable, and I was easily drawn into the world that she created. At times I felt as hot and bothered and exhausted as Cory, struggling to adapt to the heat of a world far from earth, or as frozen as Thayen, drenched and shivering from experiencing temperatures well below her norm.

The story moved rapidly, and I was drawn in very quickly, and kept tapping the pages of my kindle much longer than I should really have been awake.

I've been reading Science Fiction for a long time. This story is good. It's not simplistic, but neither is it so far out of left field that it has more culture than character. It's a really good tale with enough twists and turns to keep you flicking the pages, and the characters are real and develop from moment to moment. I'm now looking forward to reading the next one.

"This was a good story and I really liked the characters but this read more like a really long Prologue rather than an actual full book. The chapters seemed to break in random places as if someone just counted every so many pages and placed a chapter there. There wasn't really a concrete story being told. It's written more like a detailed account of someones life. Like watching a real life family live and writing each conversation and event in detail. I actually really liked that about the book but it had no real ending to it. I looked up what the series is about and it seems that this is a lead in for the 2nd book. I don't know if I liked it enough to buy the rest of the series. I did enjoy it and it has a unique group of characters, rather than the young sexy hearth throb the hero is actually an older  widower in his 50's with adult children and the heroine is a widowed woman in her 30's. I feel like this book is still a little on the premature side. I can't put my finger on it but the book felt lacking to me. I didn't fully understand the characters and their thoughts and feelings. I felt a little disconnected from where they were all coming from. Also the romance seemed rushed in the end and went from no love to instantly in love very quickly with no real lead in or gradual build up.

"This is my first book by this author, so I didn't really know what to expect. I found the beginning of the story a little bit hard to get into - not because it was badly written, but because of the subject matter that it covers. Cassie, the heroine, suffers a traumatic event that will shape the rest of her life. How she deals with this affects not only herself but those around her. The event is not allowed to rest though, the perpetrator come back to haunt her.

Once the story moves into the present day, it became a wonderful, emotional and gripping story. One that certainly lives up to the term ""a real page turner"". Cassie meets her one and only love, her soul mate in Jordan - their story together is simply beautiful. But due to decisions she makes, Cassie loses eveything, causing not only her life to be affected, but Jordan's as well.

They say that separation makes the heart grow fonder - for Cassie this is so true. Jordan is never far from her mind or her heart. He loves her and he also has the ability to give her the strength that she needs. The heartbreak that this woman suffers is devastating, but it is one which gives her strength to deal with all adversity.

This story is amazing, an emotional rollercoaster that will draw you in. The characters that Krissy V has written were superb - they are one that will live in your heart and mind for a long time after the book is finished and put down.

A highly recommended read.

"Crave is a highly emotional story about Kiera, Kevin and Jimmy. It has that love triangle feel to it, mainly because Kiera spends a lot of time evaluating her relationships. Kiera is an emotionally stunted woman. She doesn't seem to know her worth & impresses her skewed view on those closest to her. Her best friend Kevin is admittedly in love with her, but demonstrates a lot of hate for her as well. It's as if his devotion has been one sided for so long it's become bitter. At the beginning, Kiera's relationship with Jimmy, a man she feels she belongs with, ends & her self-imposed spiral into depression takes a drastic turn when she has sex with Kevin. It's not hearts & flowers, you're the love of my life kind of sex. More like angry, you can get the hell out of my life kind of sex. This only proves to confuse an already confused Keira. This story centers around a woman trying to grab her bearings. Everything that she thought was real is being stripped away. She no longer has Jimmy, her man, or Kevin, her sounding board; her cupcake business is in ruins. Her life at the end of her twenties isn't turning out so great. Without giving too much away, this story has me on the fence. I liked it, and yet I found myself not really enjoying the heroine. Let me clarify; part of me liked her and understood her, and yet part of me wanted to slap her and tell her to man the heck up. She needed to open her eyes.

In the hands of most writers I would have probably been bored to tears but Mr. Moody creates a fun and entertaining look into the quirks and idiosyncrasies of your standard Baptist style evangelical church. As one who has spent many years in ministry I can say he hit the nail on the head. No matter where you are or what you are doing people are a trip.

If you're the type that likes easy going stories with no stress or books that won't keep you up too late at night I suggest getting yourself a copy.

If you're concerned about the book being preachy because of the topic you have nothing to fear. There is very little Biblical reference at all. It's more about the people and the inner workings of ministry in general. You'll laugh and be entertained. Even non-believers will enjoy this book. It was a nice stressless experience for me and I enjoyed it much more then expected. It'll make a nice seashore read for a lazy vacation.

Please understand I choose not to give a synopsis of the book because it's already given at the top of the home page. I find in doing so too many reviewers give away too much of the plot.

"Alanas magic was ebbing and she knew something was happening with the Hollow. She and Bryce were going to cross path soon. Lately, Bryce was having little control of his bear and his brothers were keeping a close eye on him. He knew that Alana was in Star Lake Forest and roaring went to meet her. He didn't trust her. With much effort Alana persuaded him that the source of the problems was the Hollow losing its magic. She told him that something was draining its magic and she was the only one who could fix it. But she was lying to Bryce. She needed Liz to help her because her powers had weakened. It wasn't easy to deal with Brandon, Liz mate. He was suspicious and harsh with Alana. He could not forget Alana nearly had Liz killed. But the Hollow was in much danger it. It was worse than what they thought. The warlock, Alavar, had been Alanas mentor and was the one stealing the Hollow magic. He was a warlock dealing in black magic. They would have to fight him because without the Hollows magic the Mitchells would die. In this third story we get to know all about the Mitchells curse. Why Alana cursed Bryce and his brothers as collateral damage? I was very curious about what happened ten years ago that split them apart. Alana cannot forget Bryce did to her and Bryce could not have the woman he wanted because what Alana did. Way to keep the mystery of the situation. The author kept me intrigued from the first book. The development of the story was very interesting with much suspense, drama, action, and sex. Touching the scenes between Alana and Liz. Much feelings in there. This was the best of the three books of the Mitchells brothers. I knew it would be juicy. Love this stories.

First, it is translated into smooth modern English, which, while not conveying every subtlety of Greek, will nontheless help the present-day reader through this long work. Second, the price is under $10. Third, there is an excellent map collection at the back showing the ancient world as we see it and as Herodotus saw it.

What makes this different is the link to her mother. I think she missed an opportunity by killing her mother off.

"As a stand-alone book, The Long Earth takes its time getting started, which may put off Pratchett's usual audience. The thing is, it's not a stand-alone. It's the first half of a 2-part series, which may explain they very many apparently random events and characters and why the ending feels so odd: it's not really the end.

The Long Earth is equal parts SF and real (and very hardcore) science, with a huge number of callbacks to Sir Pterry's Science of Discworld books. Pratchett and Baxter's world-building is outstanding, believable, and meticulous. Well, aside from the steampunk airship. The humour is far more subtle than most of Pratchett's other work; more like Nation than the Discworld novels.

Like Pratchett's Unseen Academicals, The Long Earth has a vaguely hallucinatory feel. This may be intentional, or a symptom of the Embuggerance. For all that, it's a relatively quick and easy read. If you're unsure about buying it, you may want to borrow a copy from a friend.",OR,0

Since I am an English teacher and have read nothing else by the author, I wasn't expecting ""great literature,"" but a satisfying, easy read along the lines of The Hunger Games (which I loved, but it's not literary genius or anything).  I say without hesitation that this book is a masterpiece that ranks right up there with Catcher in the Rye.  I was stunned at every turn in this book. There were so many opportunities for this author to take clich&eacute;d, easy roads, but he just never did.  The voices of the characters and the supporting characters were just brilliant. This book contains some of the best lines about life and death I've ever read while still maintaining the believable voice of a teenager.

Eventually her friend confesses that her parents took her to an illegal doctor to be circumcised.  Akilah promises not to tell anyone, but these things have a way of getting told.

Akilah tells the story from the eyes of a child, but this book is not meant for children.  It could serve as a gentle introduction to the idea of Female Genital Mutilation or as a lesson in human rights to middle school students.  There is an after word by the author including more facts about FGM and an invitation for kids to email her their thoughts.  I would be interested in the sorts of emails she has gotten.

Williams-Garcia borders on overly didactic, but the tone of the book and the friendship between Akilah and Victoria save it from becoming overly so.

"""Buddhism"" implies a doctrine, and for centuries the various sects of Buddhism has paid lip-service to the skepticism, iconoclasm, and open-mindedness of Buddhism while reciting their lineage to prove their authority, prostrating themselves to statues, requiring obedience to spiritual masters, insisting their way is the right way, and promoting metaphysical ideas that Buddha Gotama would have regarded as irrelevant distractions.
As he did in BUDDHISM WITHOUT BELIEFS, Stephen Batchelor cuts through the mindless dogma and gets to the core of Buddha's teachings.  This time he has written a more personal document, starting with his experiences as a Tibetan, then Zen monk, leaving the monastic life and marrying, and searching for the historical Buddha and his teachings.  It is a compelling story.  It is not for those who want to cling to comforting beliefs, but for those who seek liberating new perspectives.  I myself have been involved with both Zen and Tibetan, and felt that their doctrines conflicted with the Buddha's teaching.  Batchelor is a breath of fresh air who cannot and should not be ignored.

"I have just quit reading Nelson DeMilles The Gold Coast. In 175 pages of rather well written prose about a rich woman I could never stand and from the viewpoint of her passive-aggressive attorney husband living in a snobby neighborhood of the famous Gold Coast of west Long Island, New York, let me tell you what happened.

Other than the narrator getting his ashes hauled a few times by his kinky, often emotionally unavailable wife, expressing a massively slow burn about his Mafia Don new neighbor, and the worlds shortest mid-life crisis, nothing has happened. Let me repeat that. NOTHING. He has described rich home after rich home, and some pleasant pieces of New York society historydropping a few names we know like Rockefeller, Rothchilds and so onother than that, zilch. Bupkis.

I do like the quietly snarky sense of humor he shows us but seldom shows the other characters, but other than that? This book is a waste of my time and yours. So, after reading it about a quarter of the way through, and it is a chubby book, I got pissed and pitched it up against the wall then rethought and put it in my bag for charity shops. Why should I suffer alone?",OR,0

"This book was quite interesting to me. I agree that many people, even Christians can't handle laments. Most of us are silenced and reduced to ""faking fine. "" No one really wants to know anything about the negative. But everyone seems to be a counselor and offers advice that's unwanted and unneeded. I couldn't relate to the author's neverending supply of supportive friends who helped her all along the way with her issues. I found myself wanting to feel more sorry for her lack of relationship with her family, but I had some questions. She left her brother out of her story almost altogether. How did he react to events?

I couldn't relate to the somewhat shallow craving for shopping and closets full of shoes. I don't lament things. I'm not into prosperity gospel. And who gets to go on a long retreat to Alaska to heal? Almost none of us. I think I was hoping for more of a workbook than a personal account. The book touches on a lot of good points about biblical laments in Psalms, Job, Lamentations. Some of the stories became repetitive and I think it could have been condensed a bit. The book is a good commentary of realizing that many of us are not ""just fine.",OR,0

Basically, the story recounts how a paranoid bi-polar man helped write and research a huge portion of the world largest dictionary.

Along the way we get fascinating peeks into the creation of the OED, Victorian and Edwardian views on mental health and quite a few other asides.
I am not sure that this is a book so much as a long magazine article (think New Yorker style). Occasionally it seems that Winchester overuses foreshadowing and previewing to ""fluff"" the work up into book length. At one point he mentions that the event he was going to talk about was the most important even in the 20th century. What he does talk about next is very interesting, but he offers no clue as to how, even in the context of the story, the event was ""the most important event."" Hyperbole like that is strewn throughout the book and does not need to be. This story is fascinating on its own.

His father was a sharpshotter police officer and the places they lived sound a lot like those I lived in as a child.  He had four brothers, all sharing the same bedroom.

In the sixth grade, he played Jesus in the Easter Passion play at his Catholic school and was on the cross.  This left a deep impact on him, as he always felt Jesus' sacrifice was bravery in action for the greater good.

He reached far beyond his father's law career by becoming chief of the FBI Behavioral Science Unit (a profiler to find serial killers) and spent forty years in law enforcement.  He worked as consultant on the Martha Moxley murder in Mass. and JonBenet Ramsey in Boulder.  His specialty was finding society's most depraved, brutal criminals.

After four decades of staring into the darkness of evil, when his wife of 32-years died, he entered a seminary for three years to search for the good and became a Brother of the Society of the Missionaries of the Holy Apostles Seminary in Cromwell, Conn.

His son, Steven, became a deputy for the Fairfax County, Virginia, police.

"Get out your fans! Whew! You'll need it while reading this one!

Brainy lab scientist Laura Manning has got a two big problems 1) she has to present the findings of her lastest project to the broard in a little over one week and 2) that would be easier if she didn't have sexier-than-sin Jay Cutler as her lab partner, all added to the fact that someone is out to get their secret files on the project by any means. So exactly how are they going to test their 'pleasure control' drug without anyone finding out their results before they present them to the board? -on themselves of course! Laura thinks that this is all in the name of science, but Jay has other ideas and after the 'experiments' are over, he's thinking of a more permanent relationship. But, ""Wildman"" Jay Cutler has really got his work cut out for him because Laura has a hard time believing it's her that he wants and not because he was under the influence of the pleasure drugs.

This is a really good debut. A very hot book. If your looking for lots of  scorching hot love scenes in a contemporary then this one is for you.  But my biggest gripe is the length, which is a little over 200 hundred pages with large type. I think the author could have added another 100 pages easily (perhaps it's the fault of the editors?). It was just over too fast for me and the overall scenes could have been more descriptive. I did enjoy it though and I'll definitely be getting the sequel. There's lots of room for improvement, but I think that Fox has a good start.

"I found this book exciting from beginning to end.  There are those who thought the first section long and boooring, and I disagree.  I honestly wanted to know all I could about the principle figures, and author Laura Hillenbrand obliged.  The people she introduces to us are real, breathing, fleshed-out people with concerns and agendas we can understand, thanks to her detailed expositions.  We can see the extravagant extrovert entrepeneur Charles Howard who becomes Seabiscuit's owner, the quiet, non-smiling trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper should be great in the role), the tough but literate jockey who has a life filled with his share of misery ahead, and above all, the unlikely horse who captured the public's imagination and inspired more columns of newsprint in 1938 than did Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, or Mussolini.
We get an understanding of the times, still depression-era with clouds of war gathering, and why a hero to ease the extreme stress of the time was necessary.  We learn much of the unpretty side of the lives lived by the jockeys.  We get the flavor of bordertown Tiajuana in the days of U.S. prohibition and anti-gambling legislation.
But the absolute highlights for me were Ms. Hillenbrand's colorful race descriptions.  I was able to picture the running of each important race and these descriptions were suspenseful.  In fact, Laura Hillenbrand's ability to keep the reader on the edge of one's seat is a welcome treat in non-fiction.
Now if you're just not at all interested in horses or horse racing, you're probably not even reading this, and if you are, I'd suggest getting the book from the library.  But for the average person who has even the mildest interest in the topic, this is abolutely a rewarding read.",OR,0
"The author, a secularist, does not bother to treat philosophical arguments for God's existence seriously. For example, he lauds Bertrand Russell's attack on the cosmological argument (p. 185) when, in fact, Russell created a straw man. In ""Why I am Not a Christian,"" Russell says that cosmological arguments all fail because they depend on this premise:

P1: Everything that exists has a cause

Or order to reach this conclusion along with one more premise:

P2: The universe exists.
-------------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God)

But Russell claims that C1 (God) would be subject to P1. God would require a cause for God's existence. If so, the argument fails.

This is absurd because I have never read a version of the cosmological argument (in 35 years of studying and teaching and writing about philosophy of religion) that used this argument premise. Of course, P1 will defeat a cosmological argument, but no one uses it!

For example, the kalam cosmological argument reasons this way:

P1: What every begins to exist, has a cause of its existence.
P2: The universe began to exist.
-----------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God).

Notice that the kalam's P1 differs radically from Russell's version: ""Everything that exists has a cause."" God, of course, did not (by definition) begin to exist, so is not subject requiring a beginning cause for God's existence. In order words, there is no reductio ad absurdum. Neither do the Thomistic or the Lebinizian cosmological arguments rely on Russell's manufactured premise.

One could go on about the cosmological argument (I devote 30 pages to it in my book, Christian Apologetics), but suffice to say that this book does not bother to critique the argument at its best, only at its worst.

That is a very bad sign indeed, but I find that many British secular philosophers are often dismissive of philosophical theism. Shame on them.",OR,0

"I could not take this book seriously after I read Chapter 1, The Myth of Calorie Math. The author quotes the study, Energy Density, Portion Size, and Eating Occasions: Contributions to Increased Energy Intake in the United States, 19772006 by Kiyah Duffey and Barry Popkin at the Univ. of NC at Chapel Hill, by saying that the study discovered the number of calories consumed per person per day increased by a jaw-dropping 570 calories between 1977 and 2006. The author of this book then goes on to state that if the average person is consuming 570 more calories than necessary per day and if the calorie-counting math we hear about daily is accurate, then the average person should have gained 476 pounds since 2006.

This is a misleading example and conclusion.  An increase of 570 calories (which I highly doubt in the first place), does not mean that the average person would gain 476 pounds! At some point, the weight gain would level out until the person reached a higher weight. In fact, the Chapel Hill study concluded that the average consumption was close to 2,374 calories/day in 2006 versus 1,803 in 1977. A human being will not weigh over 600 lbs. by eating 2,374 calories/day.

However, I do agree that these calorie studies are inaccurate, but not because calories don't matter, but because they're based on surveys, not science. The U of NC at Chapel Hill study based their information on an earlier study called, The Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS), 1977-78, which was a telephone survey in which the person with major responsibility for planning or preparing meals reported on foods purchased the last 7 days, food consumption, a list of the people (age/sex) living in the household, and guests (who may have eaten food). Let me ask you, can you tell me how much food was consumed in your household this week? I cant.",OR,0
"First of all, you cannot compare ANY books to the Diana Gabaldon series. So, when reading this book, you have to treat it as if you would any other type of book. You wouldn't compare any other authors to Stephen King or Dean Koontz, so you can't compare this book to the Oulander series either.
With that said, this book tells a great story. There's time travel, war, & romance. The story doesn't elaborate on war much at all, just basically that there is one and that's about the gist of it. But the romance that builds between the charaters and the way the author describes them is awesome! I actually laughed out loud when I read parts of this book and I did get tears in my eyes during one part. (But I won't give any of it away) You will fall in love with Circenn, and the passion he has for Lisa.
The story begins when Lisa goes back in time, she meets Circenn. Her first meeting with him and he is naked. She can't believe how barbaric & sexy he is at the same time. Right from the start you have compassion for Circenn. You also get annoyed at Lisa for being the typical mouthy female. (Come on ladies, you know what I mean!) As the story goes on you warm up to Lisa. She doesn't do, try, or say anything that you wouldn't do in today's society. Which is all she knows no matter what century she is in. You begin to feel both of their pain, and both of their passions. The end of the story takes you by suprise. I was not expecting an ending like that, but it was a pleasent ending none the less.
I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys time travel/romance stories. You just CANNOT compare it to the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon. But Karen Marie Moning does deserve an applaud for this story.",OR,0
"Even though I'm giving this four stars, part of me isn't sure I did like it very much - but that's not because Roberto Saviano's brutal and intense story wasn't interesting (via what seems a very good translation). Mostly, it's because of the nihilism of the cocaine industry, and the pointlessness of trying to do much about it. The cartels have all the power, and the money is so huge that of course they will do anything to maintain it - and frankly, banks probably depend on the cash infusions as well.

So what we're left with is a grim, brutal and horrible look at an industry that does infect our lives probably more than we like to admit. But what can we do about it? Not much. And is being educated/informed about it worth reading about it? I'm really not sure. I feel like I generally knew most of what Saviano wrote about so ably, but he certainly rubbed my nose in these gruesome stories. Is that a good thing? And why? I don't know if I have an answer for that!

I respect Saviano going all-in with this story, though, and just having this book out there is important. So even if a reader is turned off by these horrible stories, at least they have been told. So I don't need to like the story - and I think a reader should just respect the story. As long as that's accomplished, the book did its job - it shouldn't be be 'fun and glamorous' and it is not.

Readers of criminal justice will appreciate this - especially fans of true crime accounts (which I'm generally not, I have to say), so it absolutely has an audience. I'm giving it four stars with some general reservations, but with a solid appreciation for the take-no-prisoners account that Saviano has provided. He hammers the topic home, and it takes all the glamour out of the drug, that's for sure.",OR,0

"I read this book at the recommendation of my mom who LOVED it. But, when I told a good friend I was reading it, her response was, ""I HATED it."" How to reconcile the two reactions.

I'm not sure if I loved it, but I definitely didn't hate it. The book is indeed, as some reviewers pointed out, plot driven. The reader is constantly wondering what will happen next. Will our main character die of a fever or step on a poisonous snake?

But I disagree with some reviewers who feel the characters were not well drawn. In fact, my mom and I talked about the book and speculated about what would happen next. We are sure a sequel is possible. That tells me that we liked the characters enough to see them again.

What was so remarkable about this story was the place. Set in the heart of Brazil and then deep in the Amazon jungle, the book gives a vivid and beautifully written description of place. Readers never feel as if the author has taken us away from the perils that lie everywhere. It makes me not want to visit that part of the world!

The only reason I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars was the inability to believe certain things. I found myself coming out of the story (not good for a reader) and thinking, ""no way!"" First of all, would a pharma company invest that much time and money on a project and get no status reports, not a one? I doubt it. Would investors in that company allow it to do so? Perhaps for a short while but not for years. Secondly, what the strange and elusive Dr. Swenson was investigating seemed way beyond my ability to suspend disbelief. I can't say what that was in order not to give anything away.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed the book. It kept me turning pages and wanting more. What more can we ask of a novel?",OR,0

This stuffed dog is so cute and cuddly!  And who doesn't love a Corgi?  We purchased this dog for our one year old son because it looks like our Corgi.  It was the only stuffed corgi I could find in the tri color.  Our son loves it.  The package arrived quickly and very neatly packed.  We were very pleased with the delivery and  the Douglas company offers stuffed dogs in almost any breed.  Great stuffed animal and fun to snuggle!,OR,0
"My son is 3 and he absolutely loved these puzzles!  He plays with it for at least 20 minutes at a time, dumping all of the pieces together and then putting each puzzle together separately.  He rarely even needs to ask for help.  As a parent I LOVE the different shapes printed on the back of the pieces to differentiate the separate puzzles when putting them away in their own compartments.  I highly recommend it as a great toy for any child 3 and up.",OR,0
my under 2 child loves this. He peeks in and yells and crawls into and out of it with ease. He man handles this frequently and it has help up fine which for 12 bucks and a toy he actually likes is a steal. This is almost as good as a large box and it looks a lot better than one and hides away under anything large (sofa/chair) They need more toys like this to let kids use their imagination not what ever theme company's are selling them this season.,OR,0

I wrote a review b4 but Amazon didn't accept it(I was horribly angry). So it wasn't published. I bought this costume for my 4yro daughter who was In love with it. Me I hated it. It's very shiny like foil. It tore in one day and kept tearing. It was a little big but that's how I wanted so it'll last. I threw it in the trash about 4 months after purchasing it. It really isn't sturdy or tasteful.  Hope you like my review now Amazon. Wish I took a pic of it before I threw it away.,OR,0

They bounce very well, which my 1 year old demonstrated for us when she pull the container of water with the growing water beads in it, off the table!  water and bouncing bead all over!!  But, so fun to play with.  They are so relaxing.  Great for kids that need to use their hands, great sensory activity, and great way to reduce stress by just sticking your hand into a bowl of water beads.",OR,0
"Lots of fun. Easy to make the frogs jump. 4 different colored frogs (3 frogs per color). Unlike another reviewer, my fingers didn't hurt after playing this game several times. Safe for my 4 and 2 yr old kids. The game helped them practice with aiming the frogs. I love love love the setup of the pond, lily pads, and pink flower. Easy snap together assemble/disassemble. It is a little flimsy plastic case, so can be easily destroyed by unsupervised destuctive kids.  There's also a youtube review if you need to see this game in action.

Overall, a great portable game to help little ones practice hands-eye coordination. Also, anyone can join in on the game.",OR,0

"Disappointed with this one.  It's a hybrid of sorts: it tries to be a song maker, a piano, and a stacker all in one.  Unfortunately for small children, it's too bulky to really stack, and the drum and tambourine are too difficult to remove.  The piano plays pre-set songs, or tracks of songs, rather than notes, so children have to listen thru before they engage again.  Would have preferred individual sounds as (at least) an option.  Because of the way the sound settings work, and the ease in which the cymbal can activate, ours essentially plays one song over and over again.  We were definitely hoping for more, although it's not without its charms at times.",OR,0

That's not the case. Everything sinks right to the bottom it you place it in water.

With that said, and admittedly that is more my error than the manufacturer's, the Party Yacht is a fun little playset. The Party Yacht is like two sets in one. The kids can play with the set like it's a big boat, and the yacht can also ""unfold"" to create a cool little resort, with slides, a grill, a hammock and a jet-ski complete with a harness for water skiing.

Assembly is a breeze, just snap a couple pieces onto the yacht, fold it up (or keep it open) and it's ready to go. While I still think it would've been a smart move to make this into a water toy, my daughter enjoys the set as is.",OR,0

Now with the new movie coming out, thank GOD, here come the Indy figures and dolls! (As nerdy as that sounds). I chose this one over the talking Indy simply because it looks more like Indiana than the other does. It isn't the old 81 doll I remember as a kid but it'll do, for now. The detail is nice as are the accessories. Unfortunately it has ""whip cracking action"" which means if you move a lever on his back his arm moves the whip up and down.

"My one year-old son totally loves his other Oball trucks, but I admit that I was a little unsure about this one -- I really didn't think that he would figure out how it works, and I wasn't sure that it would be as ""fun"" as a dump truck or bulldozer. Well, I unpacked it from the frustrating packaging one night and left it on the floor, and the next morning he found it while I was making breakfast. By the time I came over to see what he was doing, he was opening the sides up and taking he cars out, stacking other things in there, closing it up again, and running the truck around. There's even a little ramp that comes down the back for the cars to come down from.

The only downside for me on this one is that the design seems a little more finicky than most toys we use at this age. When you're closing either one of the sides of the carrier or the ramp, their are bits on either end of it that need to snap in. To get both, you either need to realize that you need to push in on both edges of the ramp and on both ends of the each of the flap down sides, or you need to apply pressure pretty exactly in the middle -- so with a young child, it's super common for just one end to snap in and the other end to still be unlatched, which in this house sometimes means that the doors flop back open when you hit a bump. It's not the end of the world, and I'm sure he'll figure it out as he gets a bit older -- but it's occasionally frustrating for him now.",OR,0
"My children enjoyed this game when they were in the 2 to 4 year old range. There's a little memory practice going on combined with color matching.

To play the game a bunch of cardboard fish are placed color side down in the center of the play area. Each player is given a plastic boat with 4 slots in it. Players use a plastic fishing pole with a suction cup on the end to pick up fish from the center. If the fish matches their boat's color the player gets to put the fish in his or her boat. If it doesn't match the color then the fish goes back into the center. This is where the memory aspect comes in. The other players need to remember where a fish was placed back in the center if it happened to be of their color. It doesn't take much memory to remember one fish location until your turn comes around, but this is really for the very youngest game players. The first player to fill their boat wins. There is a variant that lets it use the numbers on the colored fish to play the classic go fish game of making sets and asking other players for matches. This variant stretches the age appropriateness up to maybe 4 years old. The Go Fish game lost its appeal for my children once the youngest was 4. They moved on to more advanced memory games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magic-Labyrinth-Board-Game/dp/B003RDJYMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magic Labyrinth Board Game</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hide-and-Eeek/dp/B003D7EPQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hide and Eeek</a>&nbsp;after that.

The pieces are colorful and attractive. The game lasted fine through a couple of years of use. The suction cup worked okay for us. The game would probably work fine in a preschool classroom.

All in all it's a fun little game for the very youngest of gamers at a cheap price.",OR,0
"This is absolutely a brilliant,entertaining and challenging game,The price is reasonable and will stand up to years of use, either in a home or school-type environment
.However,care must be taken around small children who want to place things in their mouth,as several pieces are small enough to be swallowed. Also you have to be careful not to lose any of the pieces because any loss would render the game worthless. The quality of the game is excellent and the booklet of rules, puzzles and solutions is also excellent The booklet has a coil binding,so it can lie flat,the paper is very high quality as is the colored printing and it will withstand a lot of use. However the solution symbols are very tiny ,requiring lots of light and good eyesight or glasses.
 There are 60 puzzles ,grouped in 5 degrees of difficulty,Starter,Junior,Expert,,Master and Wizard.,each having 12 puzzles. The game resembles Rush Hour..but on Steroids. I would rate the difficulty level as 2,4,6,8 and  10 as the puzzles go from Starter to Wizard. For example the most difficult Starter puzzle,# 12 requires 26 moves to solve,the Expert puzzle # 36 requires 32 moves and the Wizard puzzle # 60 requires 123 moves to solve.
 So,there you go ,suitsable for all ages and puzzle solving skills.
Even younger ones will have fun playing with the game ,by ignoring the given puzzles and simply spilling out the pieces and trying to place them all in the tray,.
 I give this game 5* even though the packaging is not very good. First the package is about 3 or 4 times larger than it needs to be,the ""window"" should have had a heavy cellopane cover ( you can make one),and it should come with a cloth bag for storage or travel ( something else you can make.) It's a good idea to keep those nice bags that come with wine ,cosmetic ,etc.,bottles for this..",OR,0

"I love the way these 1/2 inch earrings fit on my lobes and the way they are made. The two rows of stones are set beautifully and these are delicate, not flashy, looking earrings. They are so fine looking that anyone would think that they are genuine diamonds. They are appropriate for everyday wear and I have even slept with them on because they are so comfortable. They have a secure snap closure, they type found on fine jewelry, not that silly hook finding that breaks off so easily.

Surprisingly, I've used it for a week on my Rolex Perpetual Oyster and it has been keeping perfect time. It is super quiet and has several different modes you can choose from. It also comes with an attachment for different size watch faces. It looks really nice on my nightstand eventhough it is made of plastic it does have a wood finish look and the clear cover prevents dust and dirt from the outside.

"The watch is great! Sleek and the perfect size (not too small, not too big) but the only reason I didn't give it 5/5 stars is because there isn't a timer setting. You can switch it to a ""seconds"" setting where it will count up seconds of the actual time it is, but you cannot start a timer that will count up minutes. I do really like the watch though, it's comfortable -- that's huge for me because I usually can't wear things on my fingers or wrists for a long time and I've had the watch on already for two days.

My main annoyance is that the outside is showing wear after only a month.  It has scratches form spots I can not explain.

"1. Like other complaints already posted, the US size was actually a 2nd step down...not just 1.
2. The inside fake-shirt is a bit of material sewn onto ONE side of the front collar, so it's obvious there is no 2nd, inside layer. So at the top, just the button-side got the extra material-flap to present the illusion of a 2nd shirt - BUT NOT the shirt's left side. SO stupid-looking!
3. I tried to return this and the customer service was bad - To return, you will have to pay for shipping costs and they will not offer apologies. They will condescendingly blame you for not reading the ""clear description"" of their product.

They even work on my soft over-the-knee microfiber boots. I do, however, have 2 minor issues. The ""hook' mentioned in the description, is actually a loop of plastic. You would still need something like a hook to hang the boots off of a rod or another hook. The insert is also pretty slick and easily slides out of my boots, when I hold them by the loop.... so hanging from this loop may not be possible, to begin with. (Maybe I'm doing something wrong?)

I'm not that big and ordered a medium (36C but only because I'm nursing) and this bra fit perfectly. I wear it whenever I'm at home. It's too thin to wear out (you can, but it is obviously not padded), but I wear it all day and night since I stay home with the baby. It's been two months since I've had this bra, and I wash them every other week or so (I have the tan and the black) and they did fade a bit, but otherwise they're in good shape. I even wear them when I am walking outside with the baby in her stroller.

"These are good quality jeans, and aside from the leg opening, the fit is comparable to the 712 straight leg jeans. They are mid rise, slim fit and have flattering pocket placement (no mom jeans here!). Overall I liked them, but opted to return them because I found the flare to be too much. I have fairly short legs, so I find skinny or straight leg jeans to be more flattering, but I do have some boots that I thought would look better with a wider leg opening. But these are more what I would describe as ""flare"" cut, not bootcut, since they fairly wide at the bottom. I can feel them brushing past eachother when I walk and the look just isn't ""me"" I suppose. Still, it's a great quality pair of jeans with a good fit if this is the style you're looking for!",OR,0

Fit wise, for the most part it did fit me as it should, even the breast area provided appropriate coverage. I just was not at all comfortable in this suit.

"I have high arches and because of this, initially found that the part of the shoe that goes over the top of my foot close to my ankle is so rigid that they were uncomfortable to wear for more than a little while at a time. Fortunately, since they are leather, the break-in was very brief and they are now extremely comfortable. Additionally, they are great looking and seem to be very high quality--I am confident that they will last.  Also, I think the footbed is very comfortable and they seem to support my high arches just fine. I have both the patent black leather and the blue Cayman style. The blue Cayman is absolutely Exquisite and the color in the picture does not do the shoe Justice. It is a beautiful almost metallic silvery blue and I just love it.

Also be sure you understand the difference between the professional clog and the pro XP mule. I find the pro XP mule to be significantly more comfortable than the regular professional clog and worth the extra money.",OR,0
"About me:  I do not call my self a runner.  When I run, I like to trail run.  I typically do 3+ miles every weekend.  I have done three Spartan races and am training for a Beast this month, so I've tapered up to 13.2 miles.  I'm 46 and could still stand to drop about 20 lbs.  5,8"" and 190 lbs.

I have ran two Spartans in the Reebok All-Terrains, and loved them...except for the support.  They are definitely minimalist shoes.  That's exactly why I bought these.  As much as I love the Reeboks for what they do well (grip, drain, etc.), my knees need more cushion.  I did a ton of research and came to the conclusion that the Salomon Speedcross 3 has the most cushion of any trail shoe.  I've now ran in them on four separate occasions, and did my longest run ever in them.  They will be my shoes for the Spartan Beast this month.  My expectation is that they will do as well as my Reeboks, but with more support.",OR,0
"OK.  There are multiple, varying reviews on these boots.  Some people say that they are a little big, some say they're ridiculously big... IF YOU OWN ANY OTHER TIMBERLAND SHOES OR BOOTS, JUST ORDER ONE FULL SIZE SMALLER THAN THOSE.

The confusion is that Timberlands (in every other case) run big and require you to wear a half size smaller than normal.  Therefore, if you don't own any Timberlands, order these ONE AND A HALF sizes smaller than your normal shoe size.  Period.  I usually wear a 12.  In Timberlands I wear an 11.5 and in these I needed a 10.5 (yes, this is all ridiculous and I actually can't believe I'm writing all of this right now).

Summary:
Timberlands in general - minus a half your normal size.
THESE Timberlands - minus one and a half your normal size.

These boots are awesome, light, not clunky, soft feeling footbed, nice arch support, look great and I really like them. 4 stars instead of five for the ridiculously stupid sizing and forcing me to get involved.  But it was aggravating to have to return the 11's which I bought based on some other completely unthorough reviews.",OR,0
"I own a bunch of CK dress shirts and know the brand for making quality shirts that hold up to years of use. This shirt seems like no exception to that rule but I was a bit surprised to find that the fit is a bit tight. So buyer beware, if you're normally a size large then you may want to scale up one size to an XL.

I tend to dress a bit more casually to work and usually just throw on a sport jacket, shirt and slacks. I rarely go with a tie unless there's a reason to. So for my purposes I think this shirt will work out very nicely. I think 95% of the shirts I own are blue or have blue in them so it'll fit right in with the rest of my wardrobe.

I was also pleased to find that this shirt is lightweight and does not feel like a heavy cotton shirt. That will definitely be appreciated in the hot, muggy Midwest summer.

I would classify this as a modern shirt with a lightweight construction, buttons (instead of french cuff) all around, small collar, slim fit, and less shirt material (tail). Overall I'm quite pleased with the shirt but I'd probably go a size up if ordering another.",OR,0
"Unpacking this suitcase I was instantly impressed with the color, weight and durability of the case. The zippers move freely and once opened the case has compartments on both sides. The left side is your standard open suitcase compartment with straps to hold down clothes and a small zippered compartment on the side. The right side zips all the way around to cover clothes packed on that side then in addition the zipper top has 3 additional pockets, 1 zippered and two open sided, built into that cover. This will allow me to pack my toiletries without adding the bulk of a toiletry case. The bag also features a built in TSA approved lock which locks down the zipper pulls keeping your items secure yet accessible to TSA inspection. The four wheels allow for easy movement on both tile and carpet.

The only thing keeping me from rating this a perfect 5 stars is the fact that just opening and exploring the case with it the sides open onto ceramic tile caused slight scratching on the small popout logo in the front of the case. This leads me to believe that the case will scratch easily during travel. If I'm wrong, I will come back and update my review to a full five starts after my upcoming business trip in 3 weeks.",OR,0
"I purchased the Hanes Men's Long Sleeve Crew with Microfleece Pant Pajama Set for my son.  For the price, the quality of this set is pretty amazing.  I bought a size large and both pieces fit perfectly.  My son is about 5'11"" and 170 pounds.  Recently, he's had a hard time finding pajama pants that are the right length. So when I found this set, I had to try it.  They're just perfect!  The plaid pajama bottoms that come with this set are extremely soft, comfortable, and warm.  They have an elastic band, as well as a drawstring, so they fit a variety of sizes.  I personally think that the long sleeve t-shirt is a stylish choice for the younger male that doesn't want to wear a matching button up pajama top in the same print and it's a heavier material than a regular t-shirt.

I'm going to pick up another pair, most likely in the other color that's available, because they're such a great deal at this price and the fit is true to size.  These are a great choice if you're looking for a little gift for any male in your life.  The soft, fuzzy bottoms would also be nice for a woman.  Just make sure you check the sizing!",OR,0

"Super cute, made well, fits great!

My daughter is 15 months old, 25 pounds and has chubby thighs.
I read many of the reviews saying that this item runs a bit large.  I purchased two sizes since Amazon offers free returns on this item, thinking I would try them on and keep one.

My daughter currently wears 18-24 month clothing.

I purchased two sizes: 18 months and the 2T.

The 18 month size fits her perfectly.  It's not too tight, there is room to grow in both the top and bottom.
The top is cut nice and long, so the bottom of the top sits at on her lower hips.  On my daughter, the hem of the top covers the waist of the bottoms, this helps the top from riding up.
The bottoms fit nicely over swim diapers.

We have used this both at the pool and the spray ground (I have included photos, front and back).
The quality (we have had these for one week) look to be great, the zipper is sturdy and very easy to zip up and down.  I do love how easy it is to get on and off.  One other reviewer did not like the bulk of the zipper, and I can see if the the child is wearing a size that is too large, then the top might ride up and the zipper might be bulky, but we don't have this problem.

I returned the size 2T, which also could have worked nicely, they were not too big and she may have grown into them, but I liked the fit of the 18 month suit a little better.",OR,0
"I picked the ""Small"" size. For the review I chose ""Fits as expected"" but that's not EXACTLY true. The sleeves seem a bit too short for my liking, the body a bit too long for my liking. Perhaps that evens things out! But the overall size is nice, not too baggy and not too tight. Maybe a bit baggier than I'd like - it looks just like the picture - I could go for something a tad more form fitting.

The sleeves are a bit short for my liking; raising my hands up pointing ahead of me results in about 3 inches of arm are exposed.

The body length is a bit too long for my liking by about 2-3 inches. I was worried this would be very form fitting and thus wouldn't allow for a heavier shirt underneath. But the the small fits me about the way shown in the product picture. There's room for a sweater/sweatshirt.

The areas with fleece are warm, soft and comfortable. The sleeves do not have a fleece lining but they too are very comfortable - after all, arms move a lot so having a thinner material makes for easier movement. Nice.

I would not mind if it was a BIT more form fitting, it's ever so slightly frumpy (again as seen in the product photo).

Aside from the sizing.. it's still very comfortable. Has ties to make it a bit smaller, a nice little hood that doesn't fall over my eyes, the fleece is super soft and comfortable and made me noticeable warmer in a cool room.

"I have many different sets of scrubs. I do not wear them professionally, I just wear them as pajamas and lounge wear around the house because they are so comfortable and they look a bit better than sitting around in pjs. I am always looking for new sets to add into my collection, and when I saw the MediFit Men's Basic Solid 2 Piece Top and Bottom Scrub Uniform Set, I jumped at the chance to order a set.

MediFit is one of my favorite brands for scrubs. Their quality is high and their pricing is generally lower than other brands. This set was just as good as all of the other MediFit scrubs that I have purchased. The fabric is soft and comfortable against my skin. It is made from 80% Polyester and 20% Tetron Rayon, and it is highly absorbent and wrinkle resistant, which are both definite bonuses! The fabric is also quite breathable and feels light and airy. It would be ideal for someone rushing back and forth in a hospital or doctor's office.

This set of scrubs is very roomy and it has a flattering v-neckline. The top has a roomy patch pocket, and the pants have two slash pockets, and two cargo pockets, so there is plenty of pocket space for me! The waist is drawstring, which means it can fit a pretty wide range of sizes, and the pant legs are a standard straight leg fit. The scrubs have a nice classic design, which I appreciate. I am pleased with their quality and appearance.

If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!",OR,0
